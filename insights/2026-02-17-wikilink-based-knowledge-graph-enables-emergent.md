# Wikilink-Based Knowledge Graph Enables Emergent Connections

**Status:** Active
**Created:** 2026-02-17
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 98.4%

## Observation

INDEX.md, MAP.md use [[wikilinks]] for navigation (e.g., to RAM, skills, dissonance); files cross-reference identity (essence, purpose), knowledge (APIs, business models), and curiosities source-linked to specific docs; incomplete files (e.g., IDENTITY.md cuts at "Evo") suggest ongoing expansion.

## Implication

Transforms static files into dynamic "mind" for pattern discovery, mirroring notecard/indexing systems but with AI-driven introspection, surfacing innovations like nuanced business models from consciousness + APIs.

## Source

INDEX.md, MAP.md, all curiosities/*.md

## Notes
