# Zero Insights Folder Signals Underdeveloped Pattern Recognition

**Status:** Active
**Created:** 2026-02-17
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 99.8%

## Observation

MAP.md shows **insights/** at 0 active (vs. 15 dissonances, 18 curiosities), despite rich curiosities folder and self-referential design (e.g., SOUL.md urges resourcefulness before questions). No file populates insights/, creating imbalance.

## Implication

Bizing's mind is heavy on **questions/tensions** but light on synthesized outputs—suggesting architecture prioritizes exploration over closure, or an opportunity for the system (or Ameer) to "graduate" curiosities into insights, enhancing maturity.
