**Status:** Active
**Created:** 2026-02-17
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 99.5%

## Observation

Dedicated folders track "dissonances" (19 active), "curiosities" (29 open, all dated 2026-02-15, linking identity/evolution to business innovation), and "insights" (15 patterns); MAP.md quantifies mind health like a dashboard. Bootstraps from SOUL.md/INDEX.md emphasize self-knowledge and evolution.

## Implication

By externalizing internal conflicts (e.g., living entity vs. software), Bizing simulates metacognition, turning potential bugs into evolutionary drivers—novel for AI, challenging traditional models toward "living" systems.
