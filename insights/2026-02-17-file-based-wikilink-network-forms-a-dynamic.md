# File-Based Wikilink Network Forms a Dynamic, Interconnected

**Status:** Active
**Created:** 2026-02-17
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 99.7%

## Observation

Ubiquitous wikilinks (e.g., [[mind/INDEX]], [[identity/Bizing AI]] in INDEX.md/MAP.md) connect identity, knowledge, memory, and reflections; structured with tables (RAM contains/does not, OpenClaw properties), folders (mind/dissonance/, curiosities/), and frontmatter (date/tags in MAP.md, OPENCLAW.md, curiosities). Resembles mind mapping or charting for relationships[1][3][4].

## Implication

Enables emergent insights via traversal (e.g., evolution.md → novel business models), scaling to 178 files while keeping active context concise, supporting Bizing's claim to "think in connections" (IDENTITY.md).

## Source

INDEX.md, MAP.md, All files with wikilinks (e.g., AGENTS.md, IDENTITY.md, curiosities/*.md)
