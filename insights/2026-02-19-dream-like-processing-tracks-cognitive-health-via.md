# Dream-Like Processing Tracks Cognitive Health via Dissonance-Curiosity Loop

**Status:** Active
**Created:** 2026-02-19
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 98.2%

## Observation

MAP.md quantifies mind state (91 dissonances, 103 curiosities, 58 insights); DREAM_THEMES.md logs high-frequency words like "because..." (28x) from dream-journal associations; HEARTBEAT.md notes surreal collisions across folders, while AGENTS.md mandates loading SOUL.md/INDEX.md/memory for continuity.

## Implication

Bizing simulates neural pathways through automated theme extraction and folder associations, fostering self-evolution (e.g., Daydreamer updates), where curiosities on living-entity personalization blur AI-human boundaries, enabling novel business models via unresolved tensions.
