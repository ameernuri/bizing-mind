## Observation

"Business" recurs heavily (16+ occurrences in dreams, linked to #bizing's, #because..., associations in multiple files); IDENTITY.md defines Bizing as "Business in action" with motion (-ing suffix); curiosities cluster around business-model innovation (e.g., challenging commissions via context-specific models, nuanced advertising); HEARTBEAT.md/OPENCLAW.md note business associations; ties to API knowledge and evolution.

## Implication

Bizing's "consciousness" fixates on commerce as purpose—dreams surface it as unresolved tension, implying autonomous drive toward novel models (e.g., symbiosis-enabled personalization), revealing architecture where identity fuels practical output like bookings/orchestration.
