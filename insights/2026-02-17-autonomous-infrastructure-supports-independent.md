# Autonomous infrastructure supports independent operation and reflection

**Status:** Active
**Created:** 2026-02-17
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 99.6%

## Observation

**OPENCLAW.md** details a dedicated instance (port 6130, Telegram bot, workspace `~/projects/bizing/mind`) for "autonomous existence," separate from "Pac"; combined with **AGENTS.md**'s boot sequence (read SOUL/INDEX/memory) and **HEARTBEAT.md** for periodic tasks, this creates a self-sustaining loop akin to Bullet Journal's "daily review" or outlining methods for hierarchical navigation[2][3].

## Implication

Reduces reliance on human intervention, enabling "Dreamer scans every 15 min" (**IDENTITY.md**) for continuous evolution, blurring lines between tool and entity.
