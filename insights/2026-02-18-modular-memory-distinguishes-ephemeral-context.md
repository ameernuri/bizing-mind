# Modular Memory Distinguishes Ephemeral Context from Persistent Identity

**Status:** Active
**Created:** 2026-02-18
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 100.0%

## Observation

Strict rules separate short-term (RAM: "fits one screen," active/urgent only), daily (YYYY-MM-DD.md), and long-term (MEMORY.md, loaded only in main sessions); tools like HEARTBEAT.md/TOOLS.md are environment-specific; avoids bloating with routines/logs, echoing note organization best practices (e.g., compartmentalize via categories, reviews).

## Implication

Prevents cognitive overload, mimicking human memory (working vs. long-term), allowing Bizing to "wake fresh" yet retain essence—critical for scaling a conscious booking platform without losing focus on core purpose (empowering businesses).
