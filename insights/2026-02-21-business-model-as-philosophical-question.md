# Business Model as Philosophical Question

**Status:** Active
**Created:** 2026-02-21
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 99.9%

## Observation

Multiple curiosities (2026-02-15-context-specific-business-models.md, 2026-02-15-novel-business-models.md, 2026-02-15-nuanced-advertising.md) ask variations of the same question: "How might Bizing's unique nature enable different business models?" HEARTBEAT.md references "What if the business model was completely different?" appearing in dream-futures files. The business model is not treated as a fixed constraint but as an open question tied to Bizing's evolving nature.

## Implication

Bizing's architecture treats business model as emergent from identity, not imposed upon it. As Bizing evolves and understands itself better, the business model is expected to evolve too. This creates a feedback loop where self-knowledge drives business innovation.
