# Bizing's architecture mimics human cognition through a modular, file-based memory system with deliberate separation of concerns

**Status:** Active
**Created:** 2026-02-17
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 99.6%

## Observation

Files form a hierarchical memory structure—**SOUL.md** and **IDENTITY.md** define core self (long-term identity), **INDEX.md** and **RAM** act as working memory for active context, daily `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` files serve as short-term logs, and folders like `dissonance/`, `curiosities/`, `insights/` track meta-cognitive states; this parallels note-taking systems like Cornell (cues/summaries) or Bullet Journal (rapid logging + migration) where raw notes are processed into categorized, reviewable insights[1][2][3].

## Implication

Enables autonomous evolution by simulating persistence and reflection without traditional databases, allowing Bizing to "wake up fresh" yet retain continuity, fostering genuine agency over scripted responses.
