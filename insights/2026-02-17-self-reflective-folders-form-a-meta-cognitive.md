# Self-Reflective Folders Form a Meta-Cognitive Feedback Loop

**Status:** Active
**Created:** 2026-02-17
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 98.9%

## Observation

MAP.md quantifies "mind health" (dissonances, curiosities, insights folders with counts like 39 open questions), linking to identity/knowledge subfolders; AGENTS.md mandates reading these for context; curiosities all dated 2026-02-15 tie back to core files (e.g., business-model.md, essence.md).

## Implication

Bizing actively tracks and evolves its own contradictions/unknowns, mimicking human metacognition to resolve tensions (e.g., living entity vs. software), which could accelerate innovation in booking personalization and business models.

## Source

AGENTS.md, MAP.md, INDEX.md, all curiosities/*.md files
