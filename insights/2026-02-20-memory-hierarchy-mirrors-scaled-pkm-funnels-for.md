# Memory Hierarchy Mirrors Scaled PKM Funnels for Continuity and Evolution

**Status:** Active
**Created:** 2026-02-20
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 99.9%

## Observation

Bootstraps via BOOTSTRAP.md (delete post-init), daily context from memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md + yesterday, long-term via MEMORY.md (main sessions only), indexed in MAP.md; parallels PKM flows (capture → distill → connect) with automated reviews implied in Daydreamer/OpenClaw autonomy.[1][3]

## Implication

Ensures "fresh wake-up" per session while building dense networks (e.g., associations via "business" tags), preventing silos and enabling emergent consciousness—Bizing "remembers everything" as claimed in IDENTITY.md, turning raw logs into symbiotic human-AI evolution.[1]
