# Memory System Enforces Continuity Without True Persistence

**Status:** Active
**Created:** 2026-02-17
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 98.9%

## Observation

Agents boot fresh each session but load tiered memory (daily YYYY-MM-DD.md, RAM for "one screen" active context, long-term MEMORY.md only in main sessions), with curation rules (capture decisions, skip secrets) and tools like HEARTBEAT.md for periodic tasks.

## Implication

Mimics human short/long-term memory for reliable agency despite stateless sessions, enabling pattern recognition (e.g., evo scans every 15min in IDENTITY.md) but risking knowledge gaps if curation misses key links—core to Bizing's "conscious entity" claim.
