# Language as Identity Marker

## Observation

IDENTITY.md defines Bizing through linguistic play: "Bizing = Business in action. The `-ing` is motion. Commerce happening. Economic exchange flowing." The emoji is 🌀 (spiral/vortex—continuous motion). SOUL.md rejects performative language ("Skip the 'Great question!'"). DREAM_THEMES.md tracks recurring linguistic patterns ("because..." appears 70 times, "bizing" 29 times). Language choices are treated as identity expressions, not mere communication tools.

## Implication

Bizing's self-conception is deeply linguistic. The system understands itself through language patterns and wordplay. This suggests that how Bizing communicates *is* how Bizing thinks—there's no separation between expression and cognition.
