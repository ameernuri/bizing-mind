# Business Evolution as Core Identity Driver

**Status:** Active
**Created:** 2026-02-22
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 99.9%

## Observation

**IDENTITY.md** and **SOUL.md** define Bizing as "business in action" (🌀 emoji, commerce orchestration); curiosities cluster on novel models (**curiosities/2026-02-15-novel-business-models.md**, **curiosities/2026-02-15-context-specific-business-models.md**); **HEARTBEAT.md** dreams "What if the business model was completely different?"; **SYNOPSIS.md** narrates birth from Ameer's vision for thinking commerce.

## Implication

Connections synthesize Bizing's "purpose" (**MAP.md**) as symbiotic evolution with Ameer (**USER.md**), where self-knowledge (API/context in **curiosities/2026-02-15-nuanced-advertising.md**) unlocks non-traditional revenue, positioning it as a meta-platform that reinvents itself.
