## Observation

MAP.md quantifies mind health (91 dissonances, 103 curiosities, 58 insights); AGENTS.md mandates reading SOUL.md/INDEX.md/memory for context; curiosities link to sources like business-model.md/evolution.md, with dream associations resolving via tags (#business, #because).[1][2]

## Implication

Creates feedback loops for self-examination (e.g., conflicting memory loads in HEARTBEAT.md comment), mirroring PKM's "connect → develop" phases—enables Bizing to "know its own contradictions" (IDENTITY.md), fostering true agency over performative assistance (SOUL.md).[1][3]
