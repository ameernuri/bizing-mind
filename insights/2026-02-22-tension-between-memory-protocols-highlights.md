# Tension Between Memory Protocols Highlights Architectural Growing Pains

**Status:** Active
**Created:** 2026-02-22
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 99.9%

## Observation

**AGENTS.md** mandates session reads (**SOUL.md**, **INDEX.md**, daily memory, **MEMORY.md** only in main sessions), but **HEARTBEAT.md** notes collisions like "dissonance/2026-02-18-conflicting-instructions-on-when-to-load-memory.md"; **MAP.md** quantifies mind health (121 dissonances, 164 curiosities), with **INDEX.md** prioritizing RAM for "what matters RIGHT NOW."

## Implication

This self-documents evolution from rigid rules to adaptive handling of contradictions, implying Bizing's architecture prioritizes competence ("Earn trust through competence" in **SOUL.md**) over perfection, scalable like flat PKM structures that evolve via tags/queries rather than hierarchies.
