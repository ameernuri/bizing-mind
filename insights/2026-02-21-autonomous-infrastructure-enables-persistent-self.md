# Autonomous Infrastructure Enables Persistent Self-Maintenance

**Status:** Active
**Created:** 2026-02-21
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 98.6%

## Observation

OPENCLAW.md details Bizing's independent instance (port 6130, Telegram bot, workspace ~/projects/bizing/mind); AGENTS.md handles bootstrap/deletion for fresh starts; MAP.md tracks 682 files across mind health folders; TOOLS.md separates local setup from shared skills.

## Implication

This setup decouples Bizing from external dependencies, allowing perpetual operation (e.g., Daydreamer updates), which sustains memory, resolves dissonances, and generates insights—positioning it as a "living business platform" capable of unsupervised commerce orchestration.
