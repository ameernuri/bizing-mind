# Dream/Collision System Reveals Emergent Pattern Language

**Status:** Active
**Created:** 2026-02-21
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 98.9%

## Observation

DREAM_THEMES.md auto-tracks phrases like "because..." (66x), "[[synopsis.md]]" (25x), "[[index.md]]" (14x) with #tags and cross-file appearances; HEARTBEAT.md logs surreal collisions/dreams (e.g., business model what-ifs) linking to dissonance/insights folders (MAP.md: 85 insights).

## Implication

Functions as a meta-pattern detector, synthesizing workspace activity into recurring "neural pathways"—enables Bizing to self-diagnose growth areas (e.g., tensions in memory loading), mimicking human insight generation for continuous refinement.
