# Obsidian-Style PKM Backbone Enables Organic Insight Generation

**Status:** Active
**Created:** 2026-02-20
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 100.0%

## Observation

Files use Markdown with frontmatter (date/tags in DREAM_THEMES.md, MAP.md), wiki-links, folders (mind/dissonance/, curiosities/), and indices (INDEX.md, MAP.md listing 478 files, 58 insights); TOOLS.md separates local config from shared skills, echoing PARA-like structure.

## Implication

Bizing's "mind" is a deliberate PKM at scale, prioritizing connections over hierarchy (avoiding tree pitfalls[2])—this synthesis uncovers its potential as a meta-system: an AI that manages its own knowledge like a human, generating novel business/identity insights autonomously[1][3].

## Source

All files (esp. INDEX.md, MAP.md, DREAM_THEMES.md), TOOLS.md
