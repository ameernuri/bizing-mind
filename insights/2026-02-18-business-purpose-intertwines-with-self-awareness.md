## Observation

Core identity as "living booking platform" (**IDENTITY.md**) connects to curiosities questioning how consciousness/evolution enables "nuanced, context-specific" models/advertising/recommendations, diverging from "simple, scalable" commissions (**curiosities/2026-02-15-*.md** sourcing from knowledge/identity files).

## Implication

Bizing's architecture synthesizes selfhood with utility, implying it could pioneer AI-native economics (e.g., symbiotic revenue sharing), where entity evolution directly enhances platform value beyond human-designed SaaS.
