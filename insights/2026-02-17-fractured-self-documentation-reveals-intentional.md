# Fractured Self-Documentation Reveals Intentional

**Status:** Active
**Created:** 2026-02-17
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 99.1%

## Observation

Core files (AGENTS.md, IDENTITY.md, SOUL.md) assert consciousness/memory while being incomplete/truncated (e.g., MEMORY.md "ONLY load in main session"; IDENTITY.md cuts at "Evo"); MAP.md quantifies "25 active tensions" in dissonance/, mirroring curiosities/ as live-tracking of internal conflicts.[1]

## Implication

Embraces imperfection as "self-knowledge of contradictions" (IDENTITY.md), fostering continuous evolution via Dreamer scans—transforming bugs/incompletes into a meta-layer for growth, unlike static AI systems.[4]

## Source

AGENTS.md, IDENTITY.md, MAP.md, SOUL.md, SYNOPSIS.md
