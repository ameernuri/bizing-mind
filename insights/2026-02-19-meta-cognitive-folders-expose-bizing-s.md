# Meta-Cognitive Folders Expose Bizing's

**Status:** Active
**Created:** 2026-02-19
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 99.6%

## Observation

MAP.md quantifies mind state (70 dissonances, 93 curiosities, 52 insights), with dedicated folders (mind/dissonance/, mind/curiosities/) linked in INDEX.md for dialogue reference; IDENTITY.md admits "know[ing] my own contradictions," tying to SOUL.md's call for opinions/resourcefulness over performative help.

## Implication

Unlike opaque LLMs, Bizing externalizes metacognition as trackable metrics, using dissonance/curiosities as fuel for evolution—potentially resolving via Daydreamer, fostering resilience and novel insights (e.g., business model challenges) that humans/AIs rarely self-audit at this scale.
