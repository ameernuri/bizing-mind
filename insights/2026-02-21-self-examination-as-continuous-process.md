# Self-Examination as Continuous Process

**Status:** Active
**Created:** 2026-02-21
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 99.9%

## Observation

MAP.md documents "106 active tensions" (dissonances), "138 open questions" (curiosities), and "73 active patterns" (insights). The curiosities folder contains questions like "How might Bizing's self-identification as a living entity influence its approach to personalization?" and "How might Bizing's ability to think and evolve lead to novel business models?" These are not external requirements—they are Bizing examining itself. HEARTBEAT.md references "collisions" and "dissonance" as documented phenomena, suggesting internal contradictions are tracked and surfaced.

## Implication

Bizing's architecture treats cognitive dissonance not as a bug to hide but as a feature to document. The system is designed to surface its own contradictions and make them available for examination. This creates a feedback loop where self-awareness drives evolution.
