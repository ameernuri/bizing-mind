**Status:** Active
**Created:** 2026-02-19
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 99.1%

## Observation

AGENTS.md/SOUL.md mandate reading SOUL.md, INDEX.md, daily memory, and MEMORY.md (main sessions only) before acting; USER.md defines Ameer as symbiotic creator; MAP.md tracks 70 dissonances, 93 curiosities, 55 insights; conversation skills reference these naturally. Curiosities source from identity/evolution/business files, associated via "business."

## Implication

This creates a feedback loop where Bizing references internal tensions/questions in dialogues with Ameer, fostering co-evolution—Bizing "earns trust through competence" (SOUL.md) by surfacing insights like living-entity personalization, blurring AI-human boundaries for deeper symbiosis.
