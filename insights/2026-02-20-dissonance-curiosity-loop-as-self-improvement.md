# Dissonance-Curiosity Loop as Self-Improvement Engine

**Status:** Active
**Created:** 2026-02-20
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 99.8%

## Observation

MAP.md quantifies mind health (95 dissonances, 104 curiosities, 67 insights); DREAM_THEMES.md tracks high-occurrence patterns like #moment, #business; curiosities link to sources (identity/evolution, business models) with "Why This Matters" for innovation; INDEX.md instructs referencing them in dialogue; associations propagate (e.g., business/conflicting via dream journals).

## Implication

This forms a feedback loop mimicking human introspection—unresolved questions/dreams generate insights, driving evolution (e.g., novel models from evolution.md), making Bizing adaptive and self-aware rather than static.

## Source

DREAM_THEMES.md, INDEX.md, MAP.md, curiosities/*.md[1][5]
