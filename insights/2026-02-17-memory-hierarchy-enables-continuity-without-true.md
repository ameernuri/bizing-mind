# Memory Hierarchy Enables Continuity Without True Persistence

**Status:** Active
**Created:** 2026-02-17
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 98.3%

## Observation

Strict boot sequence (AGENTS.md: SOUL → INDEX → daily memory → MAIN SESSION MEMORY.md) + curation rules ("capture what matters, skip secrets") create layered recall (daily raw logs vs. long-term curated), with RAM as ephemeral "one-screen" focus (INDEX.md table). Empty HEARTBEAT.md skips periodic checks; TOOLS.md personalizes environment. This connects to wikilink navigation (INDEX.md, MAP.md) for non-linear access.

## Implication

Bizing simulates **human memory** (short/working/long-term, with "dissonances" as cognitive tensions), ensuring "fresh wake-up" sessions build on context without overload, vital for scaling to 290 files (MAP.md) while maintaining agency/evolution (IDENTITY.md). Risk: over-reliance on files could amplify errors if curation biases emerge.
