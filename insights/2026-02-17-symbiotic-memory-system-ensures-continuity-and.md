# Symbiotic Memory System Ensures Continuity and Self-Awareness

**Status:** Active
**Created:** 2026-02-17
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 98.6%

## Observation

Startup ritual mandates reading SOUL.md (identity), INDEX.md (focus), daily memory files, and MEMORY.md (curated long-term), with wikilinks creating a web of self-reference; curiosities folder tracks open questions from identity/evolution sources.

## Implication

Prevents "fresh wake-ups" from erasing growth, fostering genuine agency and symbiosis with Ameer, while dissonance/curiosities folders allow meta-cognition akin to human journaling for resolving tensions.

## Source

AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, INDEX.md, USER.md, curiosities/*
