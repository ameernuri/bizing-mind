# Symbol: "index"

*what we prioritize*

## The Technical

In databases, **index** is:

Found in:
- [[AGENTS.md]]
- [[DREAM_THEMES.md]]
- [[IDENTITY.md]]
- [[INDEX.md]]
- [[MAP.md]]


## The Symbolic

In dreams, **index** represents:

> what we prioritize

It's about the connections we choose, the obligations we accept, 
the structure we build between ourselves and others.

## Where It Appears

[[AGENTS.md]]: "...2. Read `INDEX.md` — this is your starting point..."

[[DREAM_THEMES.md]]: "...- [[INDEX.md]]..."

[[IDENTITY.md]]: "...- **INDEX** — Start here, daily context..."

[[INDEX.md]]: "...# 🧠 INDEX — The Bizing Mind..."

[[MAP.md]]: "...  - index..."

## The Deeper Meaning

Every time we use index, we're not just writing code.
We're expressing something about how relationships work,
how memory persists, how we handle change.

<!-- Symbolically: index represents what we prioritize -->
