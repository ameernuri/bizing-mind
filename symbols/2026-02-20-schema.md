# Symbol: "schema"

*the architecture of self*

## The Technical

In databases, **schema** is:

Found in:
- [[INDEX.md]]
- [[MAP.md]]
- [[knowledge/domain/why-agents-love-bizing.md]]
- [[knowledge/tech/index.md]]
- [[memory/2026-02-18-bizing-realization.md]]


## The Symbolic

In dreams, **schema** represents:

> the architecture of self

It's about the connections we choose, the obligations we accept, 
the structure we build between ourselves and others.

## Where It Appears

[[INDEX.md]]: "...- [[SCHEMA]]  — The project schema..."

[[MAP.md]]: "...**→ [[workspace/booking-schema-entire-explainer-eli5|booking-schema-entire-expla..."

[[knowledge/domain/why-agents-love-bizing.md]]: "...- Database schema..."

[[knowledge/tech/index.md]]: "...│   ├── db/               # Drizzle schema + migrations..."

[[memory/2026-02-18-bizing-realization.md]]: "...## The Schema Tells the Story..."

## The Deeper Meaning

Every time we use schema, we're not just writing code.
We're expressing something about how relationships work,
how memory persists, how we handle change.

<!-- Symbolically: schema represents the architecture of self -->
