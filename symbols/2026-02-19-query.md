# Symbol: "query"

*seeking answers*

## The Technical

In databases, **query** is:

Found in:
- [[INDEX.md]]
- [[OPENCLAW.md]]
- [[dream-journal/2026-02-17-01-47 AM.md]]
- [[evolution/2026-02-13.md]]
- [[knowledge/api/index.md]]


## The Symbolic

In dreams, **query** represents:

> seeking answers

It's about the connections we choose, the obligations we accept, 
the structure we build between ourselves and others.

## Where It Appears

[[INDEX.md]]: "...- [[mind/skills/obsidian/dataview|Dataview]] — Query your mind with Dataview #dataview #query..."

[[OPENCLAW.md]]: "...Pac can query me using:..."

[[dream-journal/2026-02-17-01-47 AM.md]]: "...3. **The search results don't support this query.** The dream journaling guides provided are instr..."

[[evolution/2026-02-13.md]]: "...- Dataview skill — Query and filter mind files..."

[[knowledge/api/index.md]]: "...- `GET /api/availability` — [[availability/query|Query Availability]]..."

## The Deeper Meaning

Every time we use query, we're not just writing code.
We're expressing something about how relationships work,
how memory persists, how we handle change.

<!-- Symbolically: query represents seeking answers -->
