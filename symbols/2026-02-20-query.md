# Symbol: "query"

*seeking answers*

## The Technical

In databases, **query** is:

Found in:
- [[INDEX.md]]
- [[MAP.md]]
- [[OPENCLAW.md]]
- [[curiosities/2026-02-20-in-what-ways-could-bizing-s-self-identified.md]]
- [[dream-journal/2026-02-17-01-47 AM.md]]

[[MAP.md]]: "...**→ [[symbols/2026-02-19-query|2026-02-19-query]]**..."

[[dream-journal/2026-02-17-01-47 AM.md]]: "...3. **The search results don't support this query.** The dream journaling guides provided are instr..."

## The Deeper Meaning

Every time we use query, we're not just writing code.
We're expressing something about how relationships work,
how memory persists, how we handle change.

<!-- Symbolically: query represents seeking answers -->
