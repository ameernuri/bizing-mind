## The Tension

INDEX.md mandates reading mind/memory/RAM as the top active context before anything else, but AGENTS.md startup sequence prioritizes SOUL.md and INDEX.md without mentioning RAM, risking bypassed working memory.

## Sources

**[[INDEX.md]]:**
> "**Read this first:** [[mind/memory/RAM]]  RAM = Working Memory. What matters RIGHT NOW."

**[[AGENTS.md]]:**
> "Before doing anything else:  1. Read `SOUL.md` — this is who you are  2. Read `INDEX.md` — this is your starting point"

## The Question

Which startup sequence takes precedence—AGENTS.md's fixed order or INDEX.md's "START HERE" RAM priority—during session initialization?
