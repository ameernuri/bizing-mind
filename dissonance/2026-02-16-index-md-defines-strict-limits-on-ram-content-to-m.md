## The Tension

INDEX.md defines strict limits on RAM content to maintain focus, but MAP.md and other files promote expansive linking to all mind components without size constraints.

## Sources

**[[INDEX.md]]:**
> "**Size:** Fits on one screen" and "RAM Does NOT Contain: Everything [...] Old completed work [...] Logs"

**[[MAP.md]]:**
> "_Complete index of the Bizing mind. Every file, organized logically._" with links to full folders like dissonance/ and curiosities/

## The Question

How should the agent reconcile RAM's "one screen" focus with the directive to reference comprehensive mind maps that exceed those limits?
