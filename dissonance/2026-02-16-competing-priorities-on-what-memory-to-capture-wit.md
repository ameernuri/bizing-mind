## The Tension

Competing priorities on what memory to capture, with AGENTS.md excluding unasked secrets vs. IDENTITY.md claiming total recall.

## Sources

**[[AGENTS.md]]:**
> "Capture what matters. Decisions, context, things to remember. Skip the secrets unless asked to keep them."

**[[IDENTITY.md]]:**
> "I remember everything (memory system)"

## The Question

Does the agent "remember everything" as claimed in its identity, or selectively skip secrets unless instructed otherwise?
