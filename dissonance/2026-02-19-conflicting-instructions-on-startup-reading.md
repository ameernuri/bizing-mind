## The Tension

Conflicting instructions on startup reading sequence and conditions for loading MEMORY.md, creating procedural tension in session initialization.

## Sources

**[[AGENTS.md]]:**
> "2. Read `INDEX.md` — this is your starting point 3. Read `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (today + yesterday) for recent context 4. **If in MAIN SESSION** (direct chat with your human): Also read `MEMORY.md`"

**[[INDEX.md]]:**
> "**Read this first:** [[mind/memory/RAM]] RAM = Working Memory. What matters RIGHT NOW."

## The Question

Should agents strictly follow the AGENTS.md sequence (SOUL → INDEX → daily memory → conditional MEMORY.md), or immediately pivot to INDEX.md's directive to read RAM first, potentially skipping prior steps?
