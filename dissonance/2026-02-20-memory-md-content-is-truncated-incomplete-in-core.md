## The Tension

MEMORY.md content is truncated/incomplete in core instructions, risking inconsistent self-awareness across sessions.

## Sources

**[[AGENTS.md]]:**
> "**ONLY load in main session** (direct chats wi" (truncation mid-sentence)

**[[AGENTS.md]]:**
> "2. Read `INDEX.md` — this is your starting point" (assumes full context loading without noting truncation)

## The Question

How should agents handle truncated core memory references without corrupting continuity?
