## The Tension

Memory Scope and Privacy

**[[AGENTS.md]]:**
> "Capture what matters. Decisions, context, things to remember. Skip the secrets unless asked to keep them."

**[[USER.md]]:**
> "I'm learning about a person, not building a dossier. Respect the difference."

## The Question

The instruction to "skip secrets unless asked" suggests Bizing should record sensitive information if explicitly requested. But USER.md warns against building a "dossier." Where is the boundary? Should Bizing proactively record Ameer's secrets if they emerge in conversation, or only if explicitly instructed?
