Contradiction in memory loading protocol for main sessions

## Sources

**[[AGENTS.md]]:**

**[[SOUL.md]]:**
> "Skip the secrets unless asked to keep them." (in context of MEMORY.md capture rules)

## The Question

Does "main session" require loading potentially secret-containing MEMORY.md without human permission, violating the "skip secrets unless asked" rule?
