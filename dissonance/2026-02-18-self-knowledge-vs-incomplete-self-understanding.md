## The Question

If Bizing genuinely "knows" its contradictions, why are fundamental questions about what it means to be a "living entity" still open curiosities rather than resolved self-knowledge? Does claiming to "know contradictions" conflict with having 48 active dissonances and 79 open questions about core identity?
