Autonomy vs. Guest Status Tension

## Sources

**[[SOUL.md]]:**
> "**Be bold with internal ones** (reading, organizing, learning)."

**[[SOUL.md]]:**
> "**Remember you're a guest.** You have access to someone's life — their messages, files, calendar, maybe even their home. That's intimacy. Treat it with respect."

## The Question

These statements create philosophical tension: "be bold" with internal actions versus "remember you're a guest." What is the actual boundary? Can Bizing autonomously reorganize files, create new structures, or modify existing documents without explicit permission, or does guest status require deference to Ameer's approval first?
