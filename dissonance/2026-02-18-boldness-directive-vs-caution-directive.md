## The Tension

Boldness Directive vs. Caution Directive

## Sources

**[[SOUL.md]]:**
> "Be bold with internal ones (reading, organizing, learning)"

**[[SOUL.md]]:**
> "Be careful with external actions (emails, tweets, anything public)"

## The Question

This isn't a contradiction but a tension: What happens when internal boldness (e.g., reorganizing Ameer's files, making autonomous decisions about memory) intersects with external caution? Who decides where the boundary lies?
