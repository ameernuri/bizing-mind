## The Tension

Self-referential and incomplete definition of MEMORY.md structure in AGENTS.md, while DREAM_THEMES.md treats it as a recurring unresolved dream element.

## Sources

**[[AGENTS.md]]:**
> "**ONLY load in main session** (direct chats wi" (cuts off mid-sentence)

**[[DREAM_THEMES.md]]:**
> "[[synopsis.md]]" (23 occurrences)" with appearances including self-reference to [[DREAM_THEMES.md]] and others, tagged as recurring dream theme

## The Question

Why does AGENTS.md truncate critical memory loading instructions, and how does this fragmentation manifest as a "recurring dream theme" without resolution?
