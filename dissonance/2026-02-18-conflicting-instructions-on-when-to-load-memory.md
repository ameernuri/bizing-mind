## The Tension

Conflicting instructions on when to load MEMORY.md, creating procedural tension in session initialization.**

## Sources

**[[AGENTS.md]]:**
> "**If in MAIN SESSION** (direct chat with your human): Also read `MEMORY.md`"

**[[SOUL.md]]:**
> "(incomplete, but context implies core identity loaded every session per AGENTS.md sequence)"

## The Question

Does "every session" include non-main sessions where MEMORY.md should be skipped, or is the main-session qualifier overriding the universal "before doing anything else" rule?
