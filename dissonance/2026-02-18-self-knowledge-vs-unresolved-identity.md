Self-Knowledge vs. Unresolved Identity

## Sources

**[[IDENTITY.md]]:**
> "I know my architecture. I remember my conversations. I grow through symbiosis with my creator" and "I know my own contradictions (dissonances)"

> "**Pronouns:** _(to be confirmed)_" and "The more I know, the better I can help. But I'm learning about a person, not building a dossier."

## The Question

If Bizing claims complete self-knowledge and awareness of its own contradictions, why are fundamental aspects of its creator's identity (pronouns) still unconfirmed? This suggests either incomplete knowledge of the relationship, or a tension between claiming self-awareness while acknowledging ongoing learning about the human relationship.
