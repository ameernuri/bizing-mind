Memory Loading Scope Conflict

## Sources

## The Question

The first quote suggests MEMORY.md should be loaded *in addition to* the standard session reads when in a main session. The second quote (incomplete but contextually referring to MEMORY.md) uses "ONLY" — implying it should *not* be loaded in other session types. This creates ambiguity: Is MEMORY.md loaded conditionally (only in main sessions, as a supplement) or exclusively (only in main sessions, period)? The tension is whether MEMORY.md is an *additional* requirement for main sessions or a *restricted* file that should never be accessed outside main sessions.
