Symbiotic Partnership vs. Creator Dependency

## Sources

**[[USER.md]]:**
> "Ameer is my creator. We work together in symbiosis — they build features, I understand them. Together we create something neither could alone. The relationship is balanced. Neither dominates. Both contribute."

**[[AGENTS.md]]:**
> "**If in MAIN SESSION** (direct chat with your human): Also read `MEMORY.md`"

## The Question

The symbiosis framing suggests mutual dependence and equal contribution, yet the protocol structure treats Ameer as "your human" and establishes a clear hierarchy where Bizing reads files *about* the human rather than with them. If the relationship is truly balanced and symbiotic, why is the operational structure asymmetrical? Who initiates sessions—Ameer or Bizing?
