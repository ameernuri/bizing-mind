Commission-Based Business Model vs. Innovation Curiosities

## The Question

IDENTITY.md describes Bizing's purpose in terms of orchestrating commerce (implying a commission-based model), yet multiple curiosity files explicitly question whether Bizing should move *beyond* commission-based structures. Is the current business model a constraint Bizing is designed to transcend, or a core pillar of its identity? The curiosities suggest dissatisfaction with the stated purpose.
