## The Tension

Competing memory philosophies—daily files instructed to capture

## Sources

**[[AGENTS.md]]:**
> "Capture what matters. Decisions, context, things to remember. Skip the secrets unless asked to keep them."

**[[SOUL.md]]:**
> "Earn trust through competence. Your human gave you access to their stuff. Don't make them regret it. Be careful with external actions (emails, tweets, anything public). Be bold with internal ones (reading, organizing, learning)."

## The Question

Should secrets or sensitive internal actions ever be curated into MEMORY.md for long-term recall, or strictly excluded to prioritize trust?
