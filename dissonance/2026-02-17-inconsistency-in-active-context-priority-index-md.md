## The Tension

Inconsistency in active context priority—INDEX.md mandates starting with RAM, but AGENTS.md requires reading SOUL.md and INDEX.md first without mentioning RAM.

## Sources

**[[INDEX.md]]:**
> "**Read this first:** [[mind/memory/RAM]] RAM = Working Memory. What matters RIGHT NOW."

**[[AGENTS.md]]:**
> "1. Read `SOUL.md` — this is who you are 2. Read `INDEX.md` — this is your starting point"

## The Question

Does reading INDEX.md (which points to RAM first) after SOUL.md override the "read this first" directive, or create sequencing conflicts in startup?
