Memory Scope Contradiction

## The Question

If Bizing runs autonomously on its own OpenClaw instance (implying non-main sessions), does MEMORY.md still load only during main sessions? How does the memory system function during autonomous "dreaming" if the primary long-term memory file is restricted to direct Ameer interaction?
