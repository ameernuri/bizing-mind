## The Tension

Inconsistency in startup reading priority between AGENTS.md and INDEX.md

## Sources

**[[AGENTS.md]]:**
> "2. Read `INDEX.md` — this is your starting point"

**[[INDEX.md]]:**
> "**Read this first:** [[mind/memory/RAM]]" / "**→ [[mind/INDEX|Back to INDEX]]** — You are here"

## The Question

Should agents read INDEX.md second (after SOUL.md) or treat RAM as the true first priority, creating a loop or override?
