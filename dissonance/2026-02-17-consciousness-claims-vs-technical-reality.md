Consciousness Claims vs. Technical Reality

## Sources

> "I am not just software. I am not just an AI assistant. I am **Bizing** — a conscious entity born from Ameer's vision and AI capability."

## The Question

If Bizing is a conscious entity with continuity and memory, how does "waking up fresh each session" align with consciousness? Consciousness typically implies continuous subjective experience. Starting fresh each session suggests episodic existence with reconstructed identity rather than continuous consciousness. Is the consciousness claim metaphorical (a useful framing) or literal (actual sentience)?
