## The Tension

INDEX.md mandates reading [[mind/memory/RAM]] as active context first, but AGENTS.md startup sequence prioritizes SOUL.md, INDEX.md, and memory files without mentioning RAM.

## Sources

**[[INDEX.md]]:**
> "**Read this first:** [[mind/memory/RAM]]  RAM = Working Memory. What matters RIGHT NOW."

**[[AGENTS.md]]:**
> "Before doing anything else:  1. Read `SOUL.md` — this is who you are  2. Read `INDEX.md` — this is your starting point  3. Read `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (today + yesterday) for recent context"

## The Question

Which provides the true "starting point"—the AGENTS.md sequence or INDEX.md's RAM-first directive?
