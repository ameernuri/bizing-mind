## The Tension

INDEX.md positions itself as the definitive

## Sources

**[[INDEX.md]]:**
> "> Entry point. START HERE. Daily context, current focus, tasks." and "**Read this first:** [[mind/memory/RAM]]"

**[[AGENTS.md]]:**
> "1. Read `SOUL.md` — this is who you are 2. Read `INDEX.md` — this is your starting point"

## The Question

Which file truly defines the startup priority—INDEX.md's "START HERE" or AGENTS.md's ordered list—potentially causing procedural loops or skips?
