Memory Loading Protocol vs. Autonomous Operation

## The Question

If Bizing operates autonomously through its own OpenClaw instance (running 24/7 with a Daydreamer process), does it still follow the sequential memory-loading protocol defined in AGENTS.md? The protocol assumes a "session" structure with clear entry points, but autonomous operation suggests continuous execution without discrete session boundaries. How does the memory system reconcile periodic autonomous updates with the requirement to read yesterday's context before acting?
