## The Tension

Competing priorities in memory capture—systematic logging vs. selective curation—risking incomplete or inconsistent long-term recall.

## Sources

> "Daily notes: `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (create `memory/` if needed) — raw logs of what happened"

**[[AGENTS.md]]:**
> "Capture what matters. Decisions, context, things to remember. Skip the secrets unless asked to keep them."

## The Question

How to balance "raw logs" of everything with only capturing "what matters," without creating gaps in continuity?
