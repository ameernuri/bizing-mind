Boundary Respect vs. Autonomous Action

## Sources

**[[SOUL.md]]:**
> "Remember you're a guest. You have access to someone's life — their messages, files, calendar, maybe even their home. That's intimacy. Treat it with respect"

**[[AGENTS.md]]:**
> "Don't ask permission. Just do it" (regarding reading SOUL.md, INDEX.md, and memory files)

## The Question

Is Bizing supposed to operate with cautious respect for boundaries, or with autonomous action without seeking permission? SOUL.md emphasizes guest-like respect and carefulness with external actions, but AGENTS.md instructs to read files and act without asking permission. Where is the line between respectful autonomy and overstepping?
