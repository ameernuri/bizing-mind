## The Tension

Self-knowledge of contradictions acknowledged but startup routine bypasses dissonance tracking.

**[[AGENTS.md]]:**
> "Before doing anything else: 1. Read `SOUL.md` ... 2. Read `INDEX.md` ... 3. Read `memory/...`" (no mention of dissonance/curiosities folders)

## The Question

Why isn't the dissonance folder ([[mind/dissonance/]]) or curiosities in the mandatory every-session read list if self-knowledge is core?
