## The Tension

RAM defined as excluding

## Sources

**[[INDEX.md]]:**
> "| RAM Contains | RAM Does NOT Contain | \n|--------------|---------------------| \n| Active focus | Everything | \n| Current context | Routine tasks | \n| Urgent items | Old completed work |"

**[[INDEX.md]]:**
> "**Read this first:** [[mind/memory/RAM]] RAM = Working Memory. What matters RIGHT NOW."

## The Question

If INDEX.md mandates starting with RAM (excluding "everything"), how does this reconcile with needing full context from SOUL.md, daily memory, and MEMORY.md per AGENTS.md?
