Memory Loading Protocol Conflict

## The Question

MEMORY.md is described as long-term memory that should be loaded "ONLY in main session," but the startup checklist in "Every Session" (items 1-3) makes no mention of MEMORY.md at all—only SOUL.md, INDEX.md, and daily memory files. Is MEMORY.md supposed to be loaded in every main session, or only conditionally? The current instructions create ambiguity about when this file should be accessed.
