## Key Patterns Documented

1. **Queue-based vs slot-based booking** - Fixed price, variable time estimates
2. **Transportation scheduling** - Routes, zones, capacity, pooling
3. **Rental workflows** - Deposits, returns, condition tracking, late fees
4. **Virtual service delivery** - Video, async, live classes, proctoring
5. **Classroom booking** - Academic calendars, equipment, hybrid delivery
6. **Multi-step service coordination** - Parts ordering, multi-vendor itineraries

## Technical Notes

- Type check revealed seed file (`packages/db/scripts/seed.ts`) is out of sync with current schema
- Errors: missing `serviceGroupId`, `updatedAt` issues on updates
- CodeSync blocked due to type errors - need to fix seed file before committing

## Files Modified

- `mind/workspace/booking-use-cases-v3.md` - Added 25 new use cases (UC-82 to UC-106)
