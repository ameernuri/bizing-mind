# CodeSync: Audio Briefing Skill Fix

**Commit:** `08d3d51`  
**Branch:** `feature/documentation-workflow`  
**Author:** Pac (AI Assistant)

---

## Summary

Fixed the Audio Briefing skill to correctly send audio files as media attachments instead of text file paths. Also added error handling for common mistakes.

---

## Changes

### 1. mind/research/briefings/event-driven-architecture-audio.md (new)

Created audio briefing content based on event-driven architecture research.

### 2. mind/research/briefings/event-driven-architecture-audio-tts.md (new)

TTS-optimized version of the briefing for voice generation.

### 3. mind/skills/briefing/audio-briefing/AudioBriefing.md (updated)

**Key fixes:**

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Sent file path as text | Send as `media` attachment |
| Single message format | Multi-part audio example |
| Generic error handling | Wrong format error handling |

**Added examples:**
- ❌ Wrong way: `message({ media: "/path" })` in text field
- ✅ Right way: `message({ action: "send", channel: "telegram", media: "/path" })`
- Multi-part workflow: Send each audio as separate media attachment

---

## Code Changes

### mind/skills/briefing/audio-briefing/AudioBriefing.md

```diff
- **Message format:**
- ```
- 🎙️ [Topic] Briefing
- [Audio file]
- 📄 Text version attached
- ```

+ **Send to Telegram - USE MEDIA PARAMETER:**
+ 
+ 1. **First audio:** Send as media attachment
+ 2. **Subsequent audios:** Send each as separate media attachments
+ 3. **Text file:** Reference message after all audios
+ 
+ **❌ WRONG:**
+ ```
+ Here's the audio: /path/to/file.mp3
+ ```
+ 
+ **✅ RIGHT:**
+ ```javascript
+ message({
+   action: "send",
+   channel: "telegram",
+   media: "/path/to/audio.mp3"
+ })
+ ```

**Error handling added:**
```markdown
**Audio Upload Fails (wrong format):**
- Make sure to use `media` parameter, not `message` with file path
- Retry once
```

---

## Context

This fix addresses a pattern where I was sending file paths as text messages instead of actual audio media. The TTS tool generates audio files, but I was sending the file path as a text message instead of using the `media` parameter to send the actual audio.

**Why this matters:**
- User gets text string instead of playable audio
- Poor user experience
- Defeats the purpose of audio briefing

**Lesson learned:** Check the message tool parameters carefully. `media` sends the file, `message` sends text.
