# Session: RAM Skill Emphasized

## Summary
Updated RAM skill with prominent "Use Every Time" note. INDEX now points to RAM first.

## What Changed

### RAM Skill Updated
**File:** `mind/skills/ram/Ram.md`

Added prominent section at top:
```
⚡ IMPORTANT: Use RAM Every Time

Before any work with the mind:
1. Read RAM ← Active context ← START HERE
2. Read INDEX — Entry point
3. Read feedback — Learnings
4. Do work
5. Update RAM if context changed
```

### INDEX Updated
**File:** `mind/INDEX.md`

Changed from "Today's Focus" to "Active Context — START HERE"
```
## 🎯 Active Context — START HERE

**Read this first:** [[mind/memory/RAM]]
```

### RAM Updated
**File:** `mind/memory/RAM.md`

Now contains:
- Active Focus (Documentation & Workflow)
- Critical (TEST BEFORE COMMIT)
- In Progress (feature/documentation-workflow)
- Recent Completed (last 48h)
- Quick Links table

## The Rule

**Every interaction with the mind:**

```
Read RAM → Read INDEX → Read feedback → Work → Update RAM
```
