# HARD MindSync — RAM + Dreamer Fix

## Summary
Fixed RAM usage (Working Memory) and Dreamer logging. RAM now correctly used for active context only.

## What Changed

### 1. RAM Corrected

**Problem:** RAM was being used incorrectly
- Dreamer was logging every run to RAM
- RAM contained stale entries from Feb 11-13
- RAM had automated system logs

**Solution:**
- RAM now = Working Memory (active context only)
- Removed all Dreamer entries
- Removed stale entries (>48h)
- RAM now fits on one screen

**RAM Now Contains:**
- Active Focus (what we're working on NOW)
- Recent Completed (last 48h only)

**RAM Does NOT Contain:**
- Logs (use `memory/sessions/`)
- Routine tasks
- Old completed work

### 2. Dreamer Fixed

**Problem:** Dreamer was logging to RAM

**Solution:**
- Removed `updateRAM()` function from `scripts/dreamer.mjs`
- Dreamer now only: DISSONANCE → CURIOSITIES → session log
- Does NOT touch RAM

### 3. Documentation Updated

**Files Updated:**
- `mind/skills/ram/Ram.md` — Clear definition, comparison table, workflow
- `mind/INDEX.md` — RAM section: "what matters RIGHT NOW"
- `mind/skills/creating-files/CreatingFiles.md` — RAM = Working Memory
- `mind/skills/dreaming/Dreaming.md` — Removed RAM from Dreamer steps
- `mind/.templates/session-log.md` — RAM reference instead of standup
- `mind/symbiosis/feedback.md` — Dreamer → session log

### 4. Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `memory/sessions/2026-02-14-ram-dreamer-fix.md` | RAM + Dreamer fix session |
| `memory/sessions/2026-02-14-codesync.md` | CodeSync session (was missing) |

### 5. Files Deleted

| File | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `symbiosis/index.md` | Redundant (INDEX is the entry point) |

---

## Tests

**All tests passed:**
- API: 13 tests ✅
- Admin: 36 tests ✅
- Total: 49 tests ✅

## Files Changed

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `mind/memory/RAM.md` | Cleaned to active context only |
| `mind/skills/ram/Ram.md` | Clear RAM definition and usage |
| `mind/INDEX.md` | Updated RAM section |
| `mind/skills/dreaming/Dreaming.md` | Removed RAM from Dreamer steps |
| `mind/skills/creating-files/CreatingFiles.md` | RAM = Working Memory |
| `mind/symbiosis/feedback.md` | Fixed Dreamer reference |
| `mind/.templates/session-log.md` | RAM instead of standup |
| `scripts/dreamer.mjs` | Removed RAM logging |
| `symbiosis/index.md` | Deleted (redundant) |

## The RAM Rule

> RAM = Working Memory — what matters **right now**.
> 
> RAM contains: Active focus, current context, urgent items, recent completions, current blockers.
> 
> RAM does NOT contain: Logs, routine tasks, old completed work.

---

## Next Steps

- [ ] Use RAM only for active context
- [ ] Archive significant work to `memory/sessions/`
- [ ] Dreamer runs every 15 mins (no RAM logging)
