# Archived: Standup — February 12
  - 2026

> This file has been archived. The standup system has been replaced by [[mind/memory/RAM]] (working memory).

## Why Archived

The standup format has been replaced with [[mind/memory/RAM]] — a working memory system where:
- Every item has timestamps
- Stale items (>48h) are archived to long-term memory
- Active context stays compact and current

See [[mind/skills/ram/Ram]] for the new workflow.

## Original Content (Preserved)

### Completed Feb 12
  - 2026

- Perplexity API configured
- 11labs API configured
- Briefing skill v2 (11labs primary
  - Telegram fallback)
- TTS-optimized briefing format
- Booking Domain Model research complete
- Event-Driven Architecture research complete
- API-First Design research complete
- Embedding crash fixed (chunk size 8000→2000)
- Server crashes fixed (resilient error handling)
- Bizing function calling fixed
- CORE-REFERENCE.md created
- System prompt updated
- Bizing knows sync systems (MindSync
  - TeamSync
  - CodeSync)
- Deep mind reorganization (INDEX.md single entry point
  - Dreamer fixed
  - DISSONANCE cleaned)

### In Progress (Moved to RAM)

- Implement booking engine schema based on research findings
- Keep mind in sync with code

### Learnings (Moved to feedback)

- CORE-REFERENCE.md prevents fragmentation
- Embedding crash root cause: Ollama context limit
- Chunk splitting: 1500 char max prevents crashes
- Resilient error handling: server continues without embeddings
- Function calling: System prompt forces file reading
- Sync systems: MindSync (SOFT/HARD)
  - TeamSync (4 entities)
  - CodeSync (check→test→commit→PR)
