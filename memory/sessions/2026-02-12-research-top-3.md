# 📝 Session: HARD MINDSYNC — Top 3 Research Topics Completed

> *Completed comprehensive research on booking domain
  - event-driven architecture
  - and API-first design*

## Summary

**Trigger:** User requested research on top 3 topics with highest impact for Bizing's booking/events/sales engine

**Research Completed:**
1. **Booking Domain Model & Reservation Patterns**
2. **Event-Driven Architecture for Booking Workflows**
3. **API-First Design & Contract Testing**

**Output:** 3 comprehensive findings documents with implementation roadmaps

---

## 1. Booking Domain Model Research

**File:** `mind/research/findings/booking-domain-model.md`

**Key Findings:**

### Database Design
- **State Machine:** DRAFT → PENDING → CONFIRMED → COMPLETED with CANCELLED/EXPIRED/NO_SHOW branches
- **Double-Booking Prevention:** PostgreSQL EXCLUDE constraint with GiST index
- **Optimistic Locking:** Version numbers for race condition handling
- **Time Slot Holds:** 15-minute checkout timeout with background cleanup

### Schema Highlights
```sql
-- Key constraint prevents overlapping confirmed bookings
CONSTRAINT no_double_booking EXCLUDE USING gist (
  resource_id WITH =,
  tstzrange(start_time
  - end_time) WITH &&
) WHERE (status IN ('confirmed'
  - 'completed'))
```

### Advanced Patterns
- Waitlist system for fully booked resources
- Buffer times between bookings (cleanup/prep)
- Multi-resource package bookings
- Recurring booking instance generation

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for state machine transitions
- Integration tests for race conditions
- Concurrent booking attempts (10 simultaneous)

---

## 2. Event-Driven Architecture Research

**File:** `mind/research/findings/event-driven-architecture.md`

**Key Findings:**

### Why Event-Driven?
- Decoupled services (don't need to know about each other)
- Complete audit trail of all state changes
- Easy to add new integrations (Calendar
  - Zoom
  - Slack)
- Resilient with retry logic and dead letter queues

### Saga Pattern for Distributed Transactions
**Recommendation:** Orchestration Saga (central coordinator)

**Booking Saga Steps:**
1. HoldInventory → Compensation: Release hold
2. CreatePaymentIntent → Compensation: (auto-expires)
3. CapturePayment → Compensation: Refund
4. ConfirmBooking → Compensation: Cancel booking
5. SendNotifications → Compensation: Send cancellation

**Implementation:**
```typescript
class BookingSagaOrchestrator {
  async execute(bookingId: string) {
    for (const step of bookingSaga) {
      try {
        await step.action();
      } catch (error) {
        await this.compensate(saga
  - state); // Rollback
        throw error;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Webhook Integrations
- **Outgoing:** Notify external systems (Google Calendar
  - Zoom
  - Slack)
- **Incoming:** Receive from Stripe (payment events)
- **Security:** HMAC signature verification

### Event Store Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE events (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  type TEXT NOT NULL
  -           -- 'BookingCreated'
  - 'PaymentReceived'
  aggregate_id UUID NOT NULL
  -   -- booking ID
  payload JSONB NOT NULL,
  metadata JSONB NOT NULL
  -      -- correlationId
  - causationId
  - timestamp
  sequence_number BIGSERIAL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);
```

### Infrastructure Options
| Option | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| PostgreSQL | Start simple |
| Redis + Bull | Small-medium scale |
| RabbitMQ | Enterprise |
| Kafka | Large scale |

**Recommendation:** Start with PostgreSQL
  - migrate to Redis/Bull when needed

---

## 3. API-First Design Research

**File:** `mind/research/findings/api-first-design.md`

**Key Findings:**

### API-First Workflow
```
Week 1: Design OpenAPI spec → Review → Generate mock
Week 2: Frontend builds against mock
Week 3: Backend implements to spec
Week 4: Integration + Contract testing
```

### Complete OpenAPI 3.0 Spec Created
**Endpoints Defined:**
- `GET /bookings` — List with filtering
- `POST /bookings` — Create (starts checkout)
- `GET /bookings/{id}` — Get details
- `PATCH /bookings/{id}` — Update
- `DELETE /bookings/{id}` — Cancel
- `POST /bookings/{id}/confirm` — Confirm after payment
- `GET /resources/{id}/availability` — Check slots

**Security:**
- Bearer JWT auth
- API key auth (for programmatic access)

### Consumer-Driven Contract Testing (Pact)

**Consumer Test (Frontend):**
```typescript
// Defines expected contract
provider.addInteraction({
  state: 'bookings exist',
  uponReceiving: 'request for bookings',
  withRequest: { method: 'GET'
  - path: '/api/v1/bookings' },
  willRespondWith: {
    status: 200,
    body: { data: eachLike({ id: uuid()
  - status: 'confirmed' }) }
  }
});
```

**Provider Test (Backend):**
```typescript
// Verifies backend fulfills contract
new Verifier({
  provider: 'bizing-api',
  pactUrls: ['pacts/bizing-admin-bizing-api.json']
}).verify();
```

### API Versioning
**Strategy:** URL versioning (`/api/v1/`
  - `/api/v2/`)

**Policy:**
- Support N and N-1 versions
- 6-month deprecation notice
- Breaking changes = new version
- Document migration guide

### Code Generation
```bash
# Generate TypeScript types
npx openapi-typescript openapi.yaml -o apps/api/src/types/api.ts

# Generate mock server
prism mock openapi.yaml --port 4010

# Generate API client
openapi-generator-cli generate -i openapi.yaml -g typescript-fetch -o apps/admin/src/api
```
