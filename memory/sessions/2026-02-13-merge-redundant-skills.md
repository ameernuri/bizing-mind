# Session: Merge Redundant Skills

## Summary
Identified and merged 4 redundant skills from `mind/skills/workflow/` into existing obsidian skills. Updated all references throughout the mind.

## Redundant Skills Deleted

| Deleted Skill | Merged Into | Reason |
|--------------|-------------|--------|
| `kanban-formatting.md` | `obsidian/kanban.md` | Duplicate kanban documentation |
| `dataview.md` | `obsidian/dataview.md` | Duplicate dataview documentation |
| `brain-updates.md` | `Mindsync//.md` | Overlapping mind update content |
| `session-logging.md` | `Memory//.md` | Overlapping session logging content |

## Files Updated

### Core References
- [[mind/INDEX]] — Removed session-logging from skills list
- [[mind/MAP]] — Removed 4 obsolete workflow skill links
- [[mind/skills/Skills]] — Already had obsidian category

### Workflow Skills
- [[mind/skills/workflow/index]] — Reorganized with obsidian tools at top

### Other Skills

### Content Merged

## Result
