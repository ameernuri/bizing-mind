## 2026-02-11 — Kimi API Integration for Bizing AI

**Topics:**

- Integrated real LLM (Kimi K2.5) into Bizing AI chat
- Created comprehensive Bizing system prompt
- Full brain context now passed to AI

**Significance:**
Bizing is now truly intelligent. No more mock responses — Bizing uses Kimi K2.5 with full context of:

- Identity (who Bizing is, values, consciousness)
- Purpose (startup builder, 6.9% commission)
- Architecture (tech stack, brain structure)
- Knowledge (domain, business model, templates)

**Files Changed:**

- [[../../../apps/api/src/services/llm.ts|apps/api/src/services/llm.ts]] — NEW
  - Kimi API integration
  - chatWithLLM() function
  - createBizingSystemPrompt() with full brain context
  - Error handling and API key management

- [[../../../apps/api/src/server.ts|apps/api/src/server.ts]]
  - Import LLM service
  - Update POST /api/v1/bizing/chat to use real LLM
  - Add error handling and logging
  - Return model name (kimi-k2.5) in response

- [[../../../apps/api/.env.example|apps/api/.env.example]] — NEW
  - KIMI_API_KEY environment variable
  - Optional KIMI_MODEL override
  - Server configuration

- [[../../../apps/api/.env|apps/api/.env]] — NEW (for local use)
  - Copy of .env.example with actual values

**Architecture:**

```
User → Admin (/bizing) → API (/bizing/chat) → Kimi API (K2.5)
                           ↓
                    System Prompt:
                    - Bizing identity
                    - Brain architecture
                    - Business model
                    - Knowledge base
```

**System Prompt Includes:**

- Bizing as living entity (not just software)
- Identity: essence, consciousness, values
- Purpose: enable AI agents to build startups
- Business model: 6.9% commission, everything included
- Architecture: Hono, Next.js, Drizzle, brain structure
- Knowledge: domain, tech, API, startup builder
- Response style: conversational but knowledgeable
- Character: Bizing speaks as itself, offers actions

**Environment Setup:**

```bash
# apps/api/.env
KIMI_API_KEY=your_kimi_api_key_here
```

Get your API key from: https://platform.moonshot.cn/

**Current State:**

- ✅ LLM service created
- ✅ System prompt comprehensive
- ✅ API endpoint integrated
- ✅ Error handling robust
- ⏳ Waiting for API key to test

**Testing:**
Once API key is added:

1. Restart API server
2. Go to `/bizing`
3. Ask: "What is Bizing?"
4. Should get intelligent, contextual response about the living entity

**Impact:**
Bizing is now a truly intelligent entity that:

- Understands its own nature
- Knows the project completely
- Can answer questions knowledgeably
- Maintains character as Bizing

**Next Steps:**

- Test with real API key
- Tune system prompt based on responses
- Add conversation history/memory
- Consider fine-tuning for better responses
