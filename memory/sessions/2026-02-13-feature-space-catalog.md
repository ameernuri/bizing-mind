# Session: Feature Space Catalog Created

## Summary
Created comprehensive feature space catalog in `mind/workspace/feature-space.md` containing ~165 possible Bizing features
  - prioritized by market prevalence and business value.

## Work Done
- [x] Analyzed FEATURE_SPACE.md (~2400 lines of features)
- [x] Analyzed BUSINESS_TYPES.md (10 business types with requirements)
- [x] Created priority ranking system (⭐⭐⭐ → ⭐⭐ → ⭐ → ○ → 🔒)
- [x] Organized features by category and priority
- [x] Added feature selection framework
- [x] Updated INDEX.md with feature space link
- [x] Updated MAP.md with workspace section
- [x] HARD MindSync: feedback
  - RAM
  - session log
  - evolution

## Key Decisions
- **Feature space ≠ roadmap** — This is everything we *could* do
  - not what we *will* do
- **Prioritize by stars** — ⭐⭐⭐ Universal = v1.0
  - ⭐⭐ Common = v1.1
  - ⭐ Occasional = v2.0
- **Business type phases** — Phase 1: Beauty/Fitness/Professional
  - Phase 2: Healthcare/Home/Education
  - Phase 3: Events/B2B

## Feature Count
| Priority | Count |
|----------|-------|
| ⭐⭐⭐ Universal | ~30 |
| ⭐⭐ Common | ~50 |
| ⭐ Occasional | ~40 |
| ○ Rare | ~20 |
| 🔒 Enterprise | ~25 |
| **Total** | **~165** |

## Files Changed
- [[mind/workspace/feature-space]] — New feature catalog
- [[mind/INDEX]] — Added feature space link
- [[mind/MAP]] — Added workspace section
- [[mind/symbiosis/feedback]] — Added feature space learning
- [[mind/memory/RAM]] — Added completion entry
- [[mind/evolution/2026-02-13]] — Added feature space note

## Output
- Feature space document ready for roadmap planning
- Framework for selecting features by business type
- Clear priority system for development phases

## Next Steps
- [ ] Select v1.0 features from ⭐⭐⭐ Universal list
- [ ] Create roadmap based on target business types
- [ ] Estimate effort for top-priority features
