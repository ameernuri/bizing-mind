# Session: DISSONANCE — Unique Tensions Only

## Summary
Fixed DISSONANCE to only have unique tensions
  - no Status field
  - delete resolved tensions.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dreamer Script
- Added duplicate check before adding
- Removed Status field from output
- Only adds unique tensions

### 2. DISSONANCE.md
- Cleaned all duplicates
- Removed all Status fields
- Now contains only unique tensions:
  - MoR Liability Scope
  - Payout Timing
  - Calendar: Build vs Integrate
  - Agent Data Ownership
  - API vs SDK for agents
  - Purpose
  - Essence
  - Values
  - Identity
  - Evolution
  - Knowledge

### 3. Dreaming Skill
- Updated format rules
- Added "no duplicates" rule
- Added "delete resolved" rule
- Simplified examples

## Before vs After

### Before
```markdown
## API vs SDK for agents

**Context:** ...

**Sources:**
- [[file1.md]]
- [[file2.md]]

**Question:** Which approach?

**Status:** 🔥 Active

## Same Topic (DUPLICATE!)

**Context:** ...

**Question:** Same question?

**Status:** 🔥 Active
```

### After
```markdown
## API vs SDK for agents

**Context:** The mind contains both API and SDK approaches.

**Question:** Which approach should take precedence?

```

## Rules

1. **Check before adding** — Script checks if tension exists
2. **No Status field** — All tensions are active by default
3. **Delete when resolved** — Remove entry
  - don't mark as resolved
