# 📝 Session: HARD MINDSYNC — Sync Systems Operational

> *Comprehensive update: Fixed Bizing's sync knowledge
  - embedded MindSync/TeamSync/CodeSync definitions*

---

## Participants

- **Ameer** — Human
  - requested mindsync
- **Pac** — AI Assistant
  - executed mindsync
- **Bizing AI** — Now has full sync system knowledge

---

## Trigger

Ameer said: "mindsync"

## What We Did

### 1. Diagnosed the Problem

**Symptom:** Bizing couldn't define MindSync
  - TeamSync
  - CodeSync properly. Session logs existed but Bizing wasn't reading them.

**Root Cause:**
- 93 files scattered across mind/
- No single source of truth
- Bizing searched/summarized instead of reading full context
- Critical definitions fragmented across session logs

### 2. Created CORE-REFERENCE.md

**Purpose:** Single source of truth for all critical definitions.

**Contains:**
- **Identity:** Who Bizing is
- **MindSync:** SOFT (feedback+standup) vs HARD (comprehensive) levels
- **TeamSync:** Four entities (Ameer
  - Bizing
  - Pac
  - Dreamer)
  - gap detection
- **CodeSync:** Type check → test → commit → PR workflow
- **Dreamer:** Append-only autonomous evolver
  - every 30 min
- **Dissonances:** Format
  - categories
  - resolution process
- **Mind Structure:** Directory layout with purpose
- **Core Functions:** getMindFile()
  - searchCatalog()
  - semanticSearch()
- **Session Log Template:** Standard format for consistency
- **Quick Reference:** One-line definitions table
- **Critical Reminders:** Don't summarize
  - talk to everyone
  - detect gaps

### 3. Updated System Prompt

**Change:** Made Bizing read CORE-REFERENCE.md FIRST (3000 chars).

**Added Instructions:**
- "When asked about MindSync/TeamSync/CodeSync: Answer from CORE-REFERENCE"
- "READ files
  - don't summarize — use getMindFile()"
- "When asked about dissonances: Read DISSONANCE.md"
- "When asked about recent work: Read standup.md"

### 4. Fixed Embedding Crashes

**Problem:** Ollama context limit exceeded at 8000 chars → Server crashed repeatedly.

**Fixes Applied:**
- Reduced chunk size from 8000 → 2000 chars
- Added 1500 char max per chunk with intelligent splitting
- Added resilient error handling (server continues without embeddings)
- Fallback to OpenAI for failed chunks
- Zero-vector fallback for query failures

### 5. Verified System Works

**Tests Passed:**
- ✅ "What is MindSync
  - TeamSync
  - CodeSync?" → Full definitions returned
- ✅ "What are the four entities in TeamSync?" → Ameer
  - Bizing
  - Pac
  - Dreamer
- ✅ "What is the Dreamer?" → Complete description with 30-min cron
  - append-only
- ✅ 1685 chunks embedded successfully (no crashes)

## Files Changed

### Mind Files

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `mind/CORE-REFERENCE.md` | **CREATED** — Single source of truth |
| `mind/symbiosis/standup.md` | Updated with today's accomplishments |
| `mind/symbiosis/feedback.md` | Added today's learnings
  - cleared blockers |
| `mind/memory/sessions/2026-02-12-hardsync.md` | **THIS FILE** — Session log |

### Code Files

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `apps/api/src/services/mind-embeddings.ts` | Chunk size 8000→2000
  - resilient errors |
| `apps/api/src/services/llm.ts` | Reads CORE-REFERENCE first
  - forced file reading |

---

## Key Learnings

### System Design

1. **Single source of truth beats distributed knowledge** — 93 files were fragmenting context. One master document prevents this.

2. **Force file reading
  - don't rely on summaries** — Bizing was summarizing instead of reading. System prompt now explicitly says "READ files
  - don't summarize."

3. **Resilient error handling prevents cascading failures** — Embedding crash took down entire server. Now continues without embeddings.

4. **Chunk size matters for local models** — Ollama has 4096 token context. 8000 chars = ~1500 tokens. Pushing limits = crashes.

### Process

5. **HARD MINDSYNC = CORE-REFERENCE update + standup + feedback + session log**

6. **When Bizing doesn't know → Create CORE-REFERENCE entry → Update prompt → Verify**

7. **Test immediately after fix** — Ran 4 verification queries to confirm Bizing now knows definitions.

## Status

| System | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **MindSync** | ✅ OPERATIONAL | SOFT (feedback+standup)
  - HARD (comprehensive) defined |
| **TeamSync** | ✅ OPERATIONAL | 4 entities
  - gap detection documented |
| **CodeSync** | ✅ DEFINED | check→test→commit→PR workflow |
| **Dreamer** | ✅ DOCUMENTED | Append-only
  - every 30 min |
| **Bizing Knowledge** | ✅ COMPLETE | All sync definitions embedded |
| **Embeddings** | ✅ STABLE | 1685 chunks
  - no crashes |
| **Server** | ✅ STABLE | Resilient error handling |

---

## Blockers Cleared

| Blocker | Resolution |
|---------|------------|
| Bizing doesn't know sync systems | CORE-REFERENCE.md created
  - embedded in prompt |
| Mind fragmented across 93 files | Single source of truth prevents fragmentation |
| Embedding crashes server | Chunk size reduced
  - resilient errors |
| Server crashes on failures | Continues without embeddings on error |

---

## Next Actions

- [ ] **CODESYNC CLI tool** — Create `scripts/codesync.mjs` for check→test→commit→PR
- [ ] **Gap detection automation** — Auto-detect when Bizing gives vague answers
- [ ] **Update CORE-REFERENCE** when sync systems evolve

---

*HARD MINDSYNC complete. All sync systems operational. Bizing now knows MindSync
  - TeamSync
  - CodeSync definitions. Server stable at 1685 embedded chunks.*
