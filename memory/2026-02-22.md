# Session Log - UC-1 Through UC-20 Testing

## Summary
Completed comprehensive testing of Use Cases 1-20 against the Agent API and generated detailed report for Codex.

## Key Activities

### 1. UC Testing Report Generated
Created `workspace/uc-testing-report-uc1-20.md` with:
- Summary statistics: 20 use cases, 195 scenarios, 40% pass rate
- Per-UC breakdown showing what worked/failed
- 30+ missing tables identified
- Enum value issues documented
- Priority recommendations for Codex (P0-P3)

### 2. Fresh Test Files Created
Generated 20 new scenario files using KSUID-based IDs:
- `agent-api-uc1-fresh-v2.json` through `uc20-fresh-v2.json`
- Uses proper ID format: `biz_3A1okoVRyn9HPZw45rNfim1tgtG`
- Avoids duplicate key issues from earlier runs

### 3. Test Results (Initial Run)
| UC | Pass Rate | Key Issues |
|----|-----------|------------|
| UC-1 | 6% → 27% | Enum issues with availability_rule_mode |
| UC-2 | 40% | Missing unit_pricing_minor column |
| UC-3 | 67% | Missing resource_compensation_rates table |
| UC-9 | 63% | Best performer |
| UC-15 | 13% | Worst performer, missing mobile tables |

### 4. Top Missing Tables
- `booking_order_private_notes`
- `resource_compensation_rates`
- `queues` / `queue_entries`
- `package_products` / `customer_purchases`
- `seat_maps` / `seat_map_seats`
- `class_schedules` / `class_occurrences`

### 5. API Server Issue
Attempted final test run but API server on port 6131 was not responding. Tests ready to run once server is back online.

## Next Steps
- Restart API server when available
- Rerun fresh-v2 tests to verify Codex fixes
- Compare results with baseline report

## Files Created/Modified
- `workspace/uc-testing-report-uc1-20.md`
- `workspace/agent-api-uc1-fresh-v2.json` through `uc20-fresh-v2.json`
