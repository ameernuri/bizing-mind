## 🧠 Dreamer

The Dreamer runs continuously with four jobs:

1. **Find Tensions** — Contradicting ideas in the mind → adds to [[mind/dissonance/]] with a question
2. **Find Curiosities** — Questions and gaps → adds to [[mind/curiosities/]]
3. **Update SYNOPSIS** — Keeps Bizing's story current #story
4. **Update MAP** — Keeps [[mind/MAP]] current

**See:** [[mind/skills/dreaming/Dreaming|Dreaming Skill]] for full workflow

---

## 📋 Dissonances & Curiosities

When the mind contradicts itself:
- File A says "use HTTP API"
- File B says "embed SDK"  
- → Real conflict in [[mind/dissonance/]] folder

Questions and gaps go to [[mind/curiosities/]] folder

Each entry is a separate markdown file: `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`

**Related:**
- [[mind/skills/dreaming/Dreaming|Dreaming]] — How dreamer finds tensions
- [[mind/skills/curiosity/Curiosity|Curiosity]] — Questions and gaps (not tensions)
- [[mind/skills/mapping/Mapping|Mapping]] — Maintaining structure
