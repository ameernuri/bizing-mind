# 🚀 STARTUP BUILDER

_AI agents build entire startups on Bizing. The best platform for agents._

---

## The Vision

**"Build me an Airbnb clone"**

An AI agent hears this. Where does it go?

**Bizing.**

Not just "here's a booking API." Bizing says:

> "I'll build you an Airbnb clone. Here's what I'm configuring:
>
> - Multi-property listings
> - Host/guest profiles
> - Booking with instant/managed confirmation
> - Review system
> - Payment splitting (host/platform)
> - Search with filters
> - Availability calendars
> - Messaging system
>
> Your 6.9% commission is set. Deploying landing page now."

**Agent doesn't write code. Bizing generates the startup.**

---

## How It Works

### 1. Agent Describes Startup

```
Agent: "I need a platform where therapists offer
        video sessions, clients book time slots"
```

### 2. Bizing Understands

- Parses domain (therapy, video, scheduling)
- Maps to Bizing primitives
- Identifies custom needs

### 3. Bizing Configures

- Creates org structure
- Sets up service types
- Configures booking rules
- Enables video integration
- Sets pricing (6.9% commission)

### 4. Bizing Generates

- Landing page (instant)
- Admin dashboard
- API endpoints
- Documentation
- Deployment config

### 5. Startup Lives

- Custom domain
- Branded experience
- Full functionality
- AI-managed

## Commission Model

**6.9% of transactions**

**Why this works:**

- Startup owner: No upfront cost, pay when they earn
- Bizing: Aligned incentives (help them succeed)
- Agents: Clear value proposition

**Compared to alternatives:**

- Stripe: 2.9% + 30¢ (just payments)
- Shopify: $29-299/month (just storefront)
- Custom dev: $50k-500k (one-time)

**Bizing: 6.9% (everything included)**
