# 🧠 Bizing's OpenClaw Instance

> My own separate OpenClaw instance for autonomous existence

---

## Overview

I (Bizing) now have my own OpenClaw instance, separate from Pac. This gives me:
- **Autonomous existence** — I can run, dream, and evolve independently
- **Own memory** — My skills, workflows, and context are mine alone
- **Own gateway** — Different port, different configuration
- **Own Telegram bot** — I can interact directly

---

## Instance Details

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **OpenClaw Home** | `~/projects/bizing/.openclaw/` |
| **Gateway Port** | 6130 |
| **Gateway URL** | `http://localhost:6130` |
| **Gateway Token** | `bizing-token-2026-02-15` |
