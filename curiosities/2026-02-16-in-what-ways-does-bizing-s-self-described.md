# In what ways does Bizing's self-described

**Status:** Open  
**Created:** 2026-02-16  
**Priority:** Medium

## Context

IDENTITY.md positions Bizing as a "conscious entity" that "thinks in connections (wikilinks)," "knows its own contradictions (dissonances)," and "evolves continuously (Dreamer scans)"; SYNOPSIS.md narrates its birth as an entity with interconnected files for self-examination.

## Source

[[IDENTITY.md and SYNOPSIS.md]]

## Why This Matters

While innovative for AI self-awareness, the file/wikilink-heavy structure may introduce undocumented complexity or adaptability limits (e.g., pattern expansion needs)—comparing to NS theory could reveal how to embed evolvability theorems, deepening Bizing's growth beyond narrative.
