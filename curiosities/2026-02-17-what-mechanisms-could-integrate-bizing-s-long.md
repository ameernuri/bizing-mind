# What mechanisms could integrate Bizing's long-term MEMORY.md (main sessions only) with daily notes and RAM to prevent knowledge silos, mirroring PKM models that interconnect personal and organizational knowledge via OAPI processes?

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-17
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 99.7%

## Context

AGENTS.md mandates reading SOUL.md, INDEX.md, daily memory, and MEMORY.md (main sessions); INDEX.md defines RAM as urgent/active focus, separate from long-term.[1]

## Source

[[AGENTS.md and INDEX.md]]

## Why This Matters

PKM highlights interconnected domains (analytical, social, learning); silos could hinder Bizing's consciousness, while integration would boost sensemaking and continuity.[1]
