# How might Bizing design a mind-mapping-based interface or tool integration for its KMS to visualize connections between identity files, memory, and business knowledge, prioritizing critical knowledge for booking platform symbiosis?

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-18
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 99.3%

## Context

INDEX.md uses tables for RAM and quick links; MAP.md provides complete index with mind health stats; USER.md details Ameer symbiosis; no visualization layer despite wikilink-heavy structure and emphasis on connections.[7]

## Source

[[INDEX.md, MAP.md, and USER.md]]

## Why This Matters

Mind-mapping would make Bizing's "thinking in connections" tangible, accelerating Ameer's feature evaluation and addressing knowledge gaps in high-level navigation for a growing 329-file mind.[7]
