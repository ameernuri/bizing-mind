# How can Bizing's extensive PKM-like structure (e.g., daily memory logs, wikilinks, dissonance/curiosities folders, and 382 interconnected files) be optimized using proven frameworks like PARA, Johnny.Decimal, or Zettelkasten to enhance scalability beyond 8,000 notes and 64,000 links without increasing cognitive friction?

## Context

Bizing's mind features structured folders for active context (RAM), dissonance (59 tensions), curiosities (80 questions), and total 382 files with wikilinks, mirroring PKM systems but lacking explicit scaling strategies like automated tagging or progressive summarization.

## Source

[[INDEX.md, MAP.md]]

## Why This Matters

As file count grows (already at 382, projected higher per MAP.md), unoptimized PKM risks overload; adopting scaled PKM principles could prevent this, enabling Bizing's autonomous evolution and symbiosis with Ameer.[1][2]
