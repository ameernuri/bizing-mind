# What mechanisms does the Daydreamer use to update MAP.md and scan for evolutions every 15 minutes (as referenced in IDENTITY.md), and how might this periodic process integrate with daily memory logs to create a progressive summarization funnel like advanced PKM workflows?

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-17
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 98.8%

## Context

IDENTITY.md mentions "Dreamer scans every 15 min" for continuous evolution; MAP.md is "Updated by the Daydreamer" with date 2026-02-17, linking to mind health folders.[1]

## Source

[[IDENTITY.md and MAP.md]]

## Why This Matters

PKM success relies on automated processes for summarization, linking, and periodic reviews to build dense connection networks; clarifying this could enhance Bizing's memory continuity and reduce manual overhead.[1]
