# How can Bizing's PKM-inspired file structure (e.g., daily memory logs, wikilinks, dissonance/curiosities folders) be optimized to handle scaling beyond 178 files, such as automating link density analysis or progressive summarization like high-performing systems with 8,000+ notes?

**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 99.7%

## Context

MAP.md reports 178 total files with dedicated folders for dissonance (19 tensions), curiosities (22 questions), and insights; INDEX.md emphasizes RAM as concise working memory with wikilinks for connections.[1][2]

## Source

[[MAP.md and INDEX.md]]

## Why This Matters

Bizing's mind risks overload without scaling strategies from PKM best practices (e.g., high link density in hubs, tag-based automation), enabling sustained evolution as file count grows.[1][2]
