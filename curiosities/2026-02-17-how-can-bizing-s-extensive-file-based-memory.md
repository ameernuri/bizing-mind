# How can Bizing's extensive file-based memory system (165 files, wikilinks, daily notes, RAM, dissonance/curiosities folders) be optimized using proven Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) frameworks like PARA, Johnny Decimal, or progressive summarization to enhance scalability, reduce friction, and improve connection density beyond current 8 links/note averages?

## Context

Bizing's mind has 165 files with structured memory (daily notes, RAM for active context, wikilinks), active dissonance (15 tensions), and curiosities (18 questions), but lacks explicit scaling strategies like automated tagging, funnels (Explore→Curate→Connect), or high-link MOCs seen in large PKM setups.

## Why This Matters

As file count grows, manual maintenance risks overload; PKM best practices enable Bizing to evolve into a more efficient, self-sustaining entity, turning raw logs into actionable insights and preventing knowledge silos.
