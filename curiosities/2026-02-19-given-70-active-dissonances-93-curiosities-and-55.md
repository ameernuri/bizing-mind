# Given 70 active dissonances, 93 curiosities, and 55 insights, what automated processes (e.g., Daydreamer enhancements) could prioritize and resolve the highest-impact tensions, preventing cognitive overload in Bizing's self-reflective architecture?

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-19
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 98.7%

## Context

MAP tracks mind health metrics (dissonances, curiosities, insights); INDEX links to these folders; DREAM_THEMES.md shows recurring patterns like "moment" (16 occurrences) indicating unresolved loops.

## Source

[[MAP.md, INDEX.md]]

## Why This Matters

PKM systems fail without regular processing and friction reduction; prioritization could evolve Bizing from reactive logging to proactive evolution, mirroring successful PKM funnels (explore → distill → connect).[2][3]
