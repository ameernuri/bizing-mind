## Context

MAP.md reports 682 total files, 121 active dissonances, 164 curiosities, and 88 insights as of 2026-02-21, while DREAM_THEMES.md tracks high-frequency wikilink patterns across files, indicating a dense, interconnected knowledge graph similar to analyzed PKM systems with 8,000 notes and 64,000 links.[1]

## Why This Matters

Bizing's mind is scaling rapidly (e.g., via Daydreamer updates), but without explicit friction-reduction strategies like automated tagging or link hubs seen in mature PKM systems, it risks manual organization bottlenecks around the 1,000-file mark, limiting autonomous evolution.[1]
