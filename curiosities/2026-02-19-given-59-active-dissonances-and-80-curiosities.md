# Given 59 active dissonances and 80 curiosities, what automated mechanisms (e.g., Daydreamer-driven reviews, tag-based rollovers) could Bizing introduce to its PKM system for periodic reflection, pattern recognition, and tension resolution, akin to weekly/monthly note distillation?

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-19
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 100.0%

## Context

MAP.md tracks mind health metrics (dissonance/curiosities/insights folders), updated by Daydreamer, but no routine processing (e.g., extraction to higher-level notes) is detailed.

## Source

[[MAP.md, INDEX.md]]

## Why This Matters

PKM thrives on reflection for sensemaking and wisdom creation; systematizing this would resolve Bizing's self-acknowledged contradictions, accelerating evolution as a "living business platform."[1][5]
