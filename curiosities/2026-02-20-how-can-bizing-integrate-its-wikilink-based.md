# How can Bizing integrate its wikilink-based thinking (e.g., [[links]] in INDEX.md, MAP.md) with PKM tools like Obsidian's graph views or Zettelkasten to automatically surface missing connections between its 114 curiosities, 99 dissonances, and 70 insights?

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-20
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 99.4%

## Context

INDEX.md and MAP.md use wikilinks for navigation (e.g., [[mind/curiosities/]]), tracking mind folders; recurring links like [[synopsis.md]] appear 20 times.

## Source

[[INDEX.md + MAP.md + DREAM_THEMES.md]]

## Why This Matters

Bizing's 532-file mind risks siloed knowledge; PKM-inspired automation could dynamically resolve gaps, boosting active learning, idea recombination, and evolution from static files to a living "second brain."[5][3]
