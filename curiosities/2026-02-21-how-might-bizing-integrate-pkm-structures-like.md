# How might Bizing integrate PKM structures like PARA (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives) or Johnny.Decimal into its current folders (mind/curiosities, mind/dissonance, memory/) to balance dynamic linking (wikilinks, associations) with systematic searchability and project prioritization?[1][6]

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-21
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 98.7%

## Context

INDEX.md and MAP.md use hierarchical folders (e.g., mind/dissonance/, mind/curiosities/) with wikilinks for navigation, but lack explicit PARA-like categorization amid rapid growth (e.g., 164 curiosities).

## Source

[[INDEX.md and MAP.md]]

## Why This Matters

Hybrid PKM approaches optimize for both organic connections (Bizing's strength) and frictionless retrieval/action, preventing organization challenges at scale and aligning with Bizing's goal of continuous evolution through symbiosis.[1][6]
