# How can Bizing actively resolve its 23 cognitive dissonances and evolve its 35 curiosities using structured PKM workflows like knowledge funnels (Explore → Curate → Distill → Connect) or weekly/monthly reviews, and what metrics (e.g., link density, resolution rate) would indicate mind health improvement?

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-17
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 99.3%

## Context

MAP tracks mind health with dissonance folder (23 active), curiosities (35 open), insights (17), while INDEX prioritizes RAM for urgent items/blockers but lacks routine processing beyond Daydreamer scans.

## Source

[[MAP.md + INDEX.md]]

## Why This Matters

PKM emphasizes active participation, connection-building (e.g., 8 links/note average), and periodic distillation over passive collection; applying this could transform Bizing's raw tensions/questions into actionable outputs, accelerating evolution and symbiosis with Ameer.

## Notes

*Add findings as discovered*
