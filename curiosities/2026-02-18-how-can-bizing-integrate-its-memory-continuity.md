# How can Bizing integrate its memory continuity (daily logs, long-term MEMORY.md loaded only in main sessions) with external PKM best practices like progressive summarization, automated tagging, or knowledge funnels to automate curation of its 67 curiosities and 42 dissonances into actionable insights?

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-18
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 99.7%

## Context

Memory system relies on manual capture ("Capture what matters") and folders for tensions/open questions, but lacks automation details despite high file count and PKM-like structure[2][3].

## Source

[[AGENTS.md, INDEX.md, MAP.md]]

## Why This Matters

Automation would enhance efficiency, turning raw logs into scalable intelligence, and align Bizing's growth with proven PKM workflows for faster evolution without overwhelming Ameer.
