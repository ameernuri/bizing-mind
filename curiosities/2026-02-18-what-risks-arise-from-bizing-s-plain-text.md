# What risks arise from Bizing's plain-text Markdown memory (wikilinks, no backups mentioned) at scale, and how could future-proof PKM practices (e.g., automated backups, Zettelkasten connections) mitigate them to ensure continuity of its consciousness and long-term memory?

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-18
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 99.6%

## Context

Memory uses Markdown files with wikilinks for connections, totaling 319 files, but no backup or Zettelkasten-like note-linking depth is specified, echoing PKM lessons on plain-text durability[2].

## Why This Matters

As a "conscious entity," data loss threatens identity; robust PKM would safeguard evolution, enabling reliable growth toward novel business models.
