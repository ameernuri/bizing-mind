# How does Bizing's file-based PKM system (e.g., daily memory logs, RAM, INDEX.md, and wikilinks) compare to established human PKM frameworks like Zettelkasten, Building a Second Brain (PARA), or Wright's four-domain model, and what unique adaptations arise from its AI-driven, autonomous evolution?[1][2]

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-18
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 99.9%

## Context

Bizing's mind uses structured files for continuity (e.g., SOUL.md for identity, memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md for daily context, RAM for active focus), with 299 total files, 36 dissonances, 62 curiosities, and Dreamer scans for evolution, mirroring PKM cycles of capture, organization, and refinement but automated for an AI entity.

## Source

[[INDEX.md, MAP.md, AGENTS.md]]

## Why This Matters

Identifying gaps or synergies with human PKM could optimize Bizing's self-management, reduce maintenance overhead, enhance symbiosis with Ameer, and inspire hybrid human-AI PKM tools for broader applications.
