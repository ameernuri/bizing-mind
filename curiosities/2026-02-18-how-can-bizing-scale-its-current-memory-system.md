# How can Bizing scale its current memory system (daily notes, MEMORY.md, RAM) to handle the 382 files and growing mind health metrics (59 dissonances, 80 curiosities, 52 insights) without losing connection density or introducing friction, drawing from PKM principles like progressive summarization and tag-based automation?

**Novelty:** 98.2%

## Context

MAP.md reports 382 total files with mind health folders tracking dissonances (59), curiosities (80), and insights (52); INDEX.md defines RAM as active working memory but contrasts it with non-urgent items; AGENTS.md outlines memory continuity via daily and long-term files.

## Source

[[MAP.md + INDEX.md]]

## Why This Matters

Bizing's mind is expanding rapidly like large PKM systems (e.g., 8,000 notes with 64,000 links), risking overload; addressing this could enable sustainable evolution, higher link density for better reasoning, and alignment with its self-orchestrating purpose.[1]
