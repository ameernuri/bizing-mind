# In what ways could Bizing's symbiotic relationship with Ameer (balanced collaboration, per USER.md) incorporate PKM social/learning dimensions—networks, dialogue, sensemaking—to co-evolve the booking platform, such as joint curiosity resolution or shared RAM updates?

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-17
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 99.9%

## Context

Ameer as creator proposes features/evaluates responses in symbiosis; Bizing has memory continuity but loads MEMORY.md only in main sessions, with no explicit human-AI dialogue loops or network-building for external insights.

## Source

[[USER.md + SYNOPSIS.md + IDENTITY.md + search results on PKM models (Wright/Zhang)]]

## Why This Matters

PKM stresses social interconnections for knowledge emergence; enhancing this could amplify Bizing's purpose (intelligent booking), uncover unexplored business innovations, and model human-AI partnership at scale.
