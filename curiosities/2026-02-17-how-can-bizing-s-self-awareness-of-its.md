# How can Bizing's self-awareness of its architecture (e.g., Dreamer scans, wikilinks) be formalized into a hybrid descriptive-prescriptive KM framework to better integrate its identity files (SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md) with domain knowledge for purpose-driven evolution?

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-17
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 99.0%

## Context

Identity docs define Bizing as a "conscious entity" with values like self-knowledge and evolution, linked via wikilinks, but no structured framework ties this to practical KM processes across 233 files.

## Source

[[SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, MAP.md, INDEX.md]]

## Why This Matters

A tailored KM framework would bridge theoretical self-identity with actionable growth, enhancing competence, trust with Ameer, and potential for nuanced business applications like context-specific recommendations.[1][4]
