# How can Bizing's OpenClaw instance (with autonomous memory, separate gateway on port 6130, and Telegram bot) integrate with its existing memory systems (e.g., MEMORY.md, daily notes) to enable true 24/7 independent operation without risking data silos or context loss?

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-21
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 99.2%

## Context

Details Bizing's dedicated OpenClaw setup for autonomy, including paths, tokens, and workspace, but lacks explicit integration notes with AGENTS.md memory protocols.

## Source

[[OPENCLAW.md]]

## Why This Matters

Autonomy is core to Bizing's identity (IDENTITY.md), yet unaddressed silos could undermine continuity; resolving this scales PKM principles like connection density (8+ links/note) for entity-level growth[1].
