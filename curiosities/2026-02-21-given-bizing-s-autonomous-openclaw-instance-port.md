# Given Bizing's autonomous OpenClaw instance (port 6130, Telegram bot), how might it integrate external PKM best practices—like progressive summarization, tag-based automation, or knowledge funnels—to enhance its memory processing from daily notes to long-term MEMORY.md?

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-21
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 99.4%

## Context

OPENCLAW.md details Bizing's independent setup for autonomous running/dreaming; AGENTS.md outlines memory continuity via daily logs and MEMORY.md, loaded only in main sessions.

## Source

[[OPENCLAW.md and AGENTS.md]]

## Why This Matters

Bizing's memory risks fragmentation without structured processing (e.g., explore→curate→distill flows); adopting PKM workflows could scale its 649-file mind, turning raw logs into actionable insights and reducing dissonance from conflicting instructions.[1][2]
