# What mechanisms could Bizing implement to automatically prioritize, resolve, or escalate its 95 active dissonances and 104 curiosities (e.g., via Daydreamer runs), preventing mind health degradation as file count grows?

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-20
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 99.7%

## Context

MAP.md quantifies mind health (95 dissonances, 104 curiosities, 67 insights); INDEX.md points to these folders but provides no resolution workflow, despite AGENTS.md's memory curation instructions.

## Source

[[MAP.md, INDEX.md]]

## Why This Matters

Unmanaged tensions could stall progress in a system designed for continuous evolution; automation drawing from PKM funnels (explore-curate-connect) would enhance efficiency and self-orchestration.[2][3][4]

*Add findings as discovered*
