# With 36 active cognitive dissonances and 62 open curiosities tracked in dedicated folders, how does Bizing quantitatively measure and resolve

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-18
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 99.9%

## Context

MAP.md reports mind health metrics (36 dissonances, 62 curiosities, 33 insights as of 2026-02-17), with folders like mind/dissonance/ and mind/curiosities/, but lacks defined resolution workflows beyond Daydreamer updates.

## Source

[[MAP.md, INDEX.md]]

## Why This Matters

Formalizing dissonance/curiosity dynamics could prevent cognitive overload, accelerate evolution, and model novel AI introspection techniques applicable to other autonomous agents.
