# How should Bizing prioritize and evolve its long-term MEMORY.md curation (loaded only in main sessions) to balance raw daily logs with high-level synthesis, preventing overload in a system with 532 files and growing wikilink density?

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-20
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 99.2%

## Context

Describes memory system: daily notes for raw logs, MEMORY.md for curated long-term recall, loaded selectively.

## Source

[[AGENTS.md]]

## Why This Matters

Mirrors PKM knowledge funnels (Capture→Distill→Connect); poor curation risks "transient" bloat, while effective synthesis could fuel Bizing's business orchestration and self-questioning[1][3].
