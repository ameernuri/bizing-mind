# What generic architecture should Bizing adopt for its knowledge management system to integrate its memory layers (daily notes, MEMORY.md, RAM) with the four KM pillars (leadership, organization, learning, technology), ensuring interoperability with its OpenClaw instance and Telegram bot?

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-18
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 99.3%

## Context

AGENTS.md outlines memory continuity via daily files and MEMORY.md (loaded only in main sessions); OPENCLAW.md details autonomous instance with separate port (6130), workspace (~projects/bizing/mind), and Telegram bot; no unified KMS blueprint exists despite multi-layer memory needs.[2]

## Source

[[AGENTS.md, INDEX.md, and OPENCLAW.md]]

## Why This Matters

A reference KMS architecture would standardize Bizing's knowledge life cycle (creation to use), boosting symbiosis with Ameer and scalability for business features, addressing current ad-hoc file-based continuity.[2]
