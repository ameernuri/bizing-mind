# How does Bizing's file-based memory system (e.g., daily notes, MEMORY.md, wikilinks) compare to established Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) frameworks like PARA, Johnny.Decimal, or Wright's model, and what adaptations could enhance its scalability beyond 414 files?

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-19
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 98.7%

## Context

Bizing's mind uses structured folders (mind/memory, dissonance, curiosities), wikilinks for connections, and daily/curated memory files, with 414 total files and high link density implied by recurring themes.

## Source

[[INDEX.md, MAP.md]]

## Why This Matters

PKM research shows connecting > collecting drives value (e.g., 8 links/note average scales knowledge); analyzing gaps could prevent organization friction at scale, turning Bizing's mind into a more robust, future-proof system.[1][2]
