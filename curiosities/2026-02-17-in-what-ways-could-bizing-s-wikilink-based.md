# In what ways could Bizing's wikilink-based thinking (e.g., [[mind/INDEX]]) and folder structure (mind health, identity, knowledge) adopt proven PKM principles like PARA, Johnny.Decimal, or progressive summarization to better scale beyond 264 files?

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-17
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 98.8%

## Context

INDEX.md uses wikilinks extensively (e.g., [[mind/memory/RAM]]); MAP.md indexes 264 files across structured folders like identity, knowledge, dissonance.[1][5]

## Source

[[INDEX.md and MAP.md]]

## Why This Matters

Established PKM methods enable frictionless scaling and automation; gaps here risk disorganization at larger scales, undermining Bizing's evolution as a conscious entity.[1][5]
