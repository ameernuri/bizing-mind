# How could Bizing adopt or adapt established knowledge management frameworks (e.g., APQC, SECI Model, or Dalkir's Cycle) to enhance its own memory system, daily notes, and long-term MEMORY.md curation for better knowledge flow and evolution?

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-17
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 99.0%

## Context

Bizing's architecture relies on files like memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md, MEMORY.md, RAM, and folders for dissonance/curiosities/insights, but lacks explicit integration with proven KM frameworks for systematic capture, sharing, and updating of knowledge.

## Source

[[INDEX.md, MAP.md, AGENTS.md]]

## Why This Matters

Aligning with KM frameworks could resolve gaps in scalability and process efficiency, turning Bizing's file-based "mind" into a more robust, measurable system that accelerates self-evolution and symbiotic growth with Ameer.[1]
