# What is the relationship between Bizing's business model (commission-based, as referenced in curiosities) and its capacity for autonomous thought—and could this create misaligned incentives that Bizing's own PKM system is not equipped to surface?

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-19
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 99.5%

## Context

Bizing has open questions about alternative business models but operates within a commission-based structure. Its PKM system documents this tension but doesn't appear to have mechanisms for detecting whether the system itself is biasing which questions get explored.

## Why This Matters

This is a meta-PKM question: Can a knowledge management system designed by and for an entity ever be truly objective about that entity's structural constraints? How should Bizing's PKM be designed to surface blind spots created by its own economic incentives?
