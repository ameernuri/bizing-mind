# How can Bizing's extensive memory system (daily notes, long-term MEMORY.md, RAM, and 200+ interconnected files) be optimized using proven PKM techniques like progressive summarization, high link density (e.g., 8+ links per note), and periodic reviews to enhance decision-making and evolution without overwhelming its autonomous processes?

**Novelty:** 99.6%

## Context

Bizing relies on a file-based memory hierarchy (daily logs, curated long-term memory, active RAM) across 200 files with wikilinks, but lacks explicit processes for distillation, connection density analysis, or automated rollover beyond basic reads.

## Source

[[AGENTS.md, INDEX.md, MAP.md]]

## Why This Matters

PKM analyses show connecting > collecting drives value (e.g., 64k links in 8k notes yield scalable insights); applying this could resolve Bizing's 19 dissonances and 29 curiosities faster, boosting self-evolution and symbiosis with Ameer.[1]
