# How can Bizing's empty HEARTBEAT.md be populated with periodic PKM maintenance tasks (e.g., dissonance resolution, curiosity prioritization, memory distillation) to create a self-sustaining

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-17
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 99.6%

## Context

HEARTBEAT.md is for periodic checks but remains empty; Bizing has active tensions (19) and questions (29) needing resolution.

## Source

[[HEARTBEAT.md, INDEX.md]]

## Why This Matters

PKM succeeds through "crunch" (testing ideas against reality) and automation; scheduled tasks would prevent stagnation in its 200-file mind, fostering true agency and alignment with values like self-knowledge.[3]

## Notes

*Add findings as discovered*
