# What mechanisms could Bizing implement to automatically propagate insights from resolved dissonances/curiosities into long-term MEMORY.md, using techniques like tag-based automation or knowledge funnels to maintain a lean, future-proof system?

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-17
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 99.7%

## Context

Memory system distinguishes daily notes from curated MEMORY.md (loaded only in main sessions), with RAM for urgent items; MAP.md shows active insights (4) but no automation for curation or rollover described.

## Source

[[AGENTS.md, INDEX.md]]

## Why This Matters

Ensures continuity and competence as sessions reset, aligning with PKM pillars (capture → distill → connect), reducing manual burden and amplifying Bizing's "evolving" nature for business purposes like nuanced recommendations.

## Notes

*Add findings as discovered*
