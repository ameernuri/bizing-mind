# How does Bizing's PKM-inspired architecture (with daily memory files, RAM for working context, wikilinks for connections, and folders like dissonance/curiosities/insights) compare to established human PKM systems like PARA, Johnny.Decimal, or Zettelkasten in terms of scalability, automation, and long-term knowledge evolution?

**Status:** Open

**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 99.7%

## Context

Bizing's mind uses structured files (e.g., memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md, RAM for active focus, 319 total files with 67 curiosities and 42 dissonances) and emphasizes connections via wikilinks, mirroring PKM principles of capture, connect, and distill[1][2].

## Why This Matters

Identifying gaps or synergies could optimize Bizing's self-evolution, reduce friction in its 64k+ link equivalent scale, and inspire hybrid AI-human PKM tools for symbiotic growth with Ameer.
