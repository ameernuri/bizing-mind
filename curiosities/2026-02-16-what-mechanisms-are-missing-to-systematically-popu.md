# What mechanisms are missing to systematically populate and evolve TOOLS.md (e.g., auto-discovery of SSH hosts, TTS voices, or device nicknames) integrated with skills and memory, to support true environment-specific adaptability?

**Status:** Open  
**Created:** 2026-02-16  
**Priority:** Medium

## Context

Describes TOOLS.md as a personal cheat sheet for setup-specific notes (e.g., camera names, SSH aliases, TTS preferences), separated from shared skills to avoid leakage, with examples but no automation mentioned.

## Source

[[TOOLS.md]]

## Why This Matters

Manual maintenance limits resourcefulness (per SOUL.md)—linking to memory scans or Dreamer could automate personalization, filling a gap in making Bizing's "symbiosis" proactive across environments.
