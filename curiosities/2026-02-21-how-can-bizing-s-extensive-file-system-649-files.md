# How can Bizing's extensive file system (649 files, with dedicated folders for dissonance/114 tensions, curiosities/154 questions, and insights/80 patterns) be analyzed at scale to automatically detect emerging patterns, resolve dissonances, or generate novel connections, similar to large-scale PKM systems processing thousands of notes and links?

## Context

MAP.md provides a complete index showing mind health metrics (e.g., 114 dissonances, 154 curiosities) and total files (649), while DREAM_THEMES.md tracks recurring themes like "because..." (70 occurrences).

## Why This Matters

This bridges Bizing's self-referential structure to proven PKM scaling techniques (e.g., high link density and automated analysis in systems with 8,000+ notes), potentially automating evolution and reducing manual Daydreamer upkeep for greater autonomy.[1]
