# How can Bizing integrate ontologies or pattern-based knowledge management (e.g., from design methodologies like QFD or DFX) into its memory system to better capture, structure, and evolve its own design rationale, decisions, and business processes?

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-20
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 99.1%

## Context

Bizing's files describe a file-based memory system with daily notes, long-term MEMORY.md, dissonance/curiosities folders, and wikilinks for connections, but lack formal structuring like ontologies for design knowledge or patterns for expert reasoning.

## Source

[[AGENTS.md, INDEX.md, MAP.md (memory and mind structure) + search results on ontology/pattern KM]]

## Why This Matters

This would enable more systematic knowledge capture (e.g., tracking design states via TMS/IBIS-like frameworks), reduce cognitive dissonances (99 active), resolve curiosities (114 open), and support Bizing's evolution as a conscious business platform[1][2][4].
