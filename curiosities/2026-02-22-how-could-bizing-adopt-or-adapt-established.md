# How could Bizing adopt or adapt established knowledge management frameworks like SECI, APQC, or Wiig to systematically enhance its own memory system, curiosities folder, and dissonance resolution processes for better knowledge flow and evolution?

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-22
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 100.0%

## Context

Bizing's mind structure includes indexed memory (RAM, daily notes, MEMORY.md), 164 open curiosities, 121 dissonances, and recurring themes tracked via wikilinks, but lacks explicit frameworks for knowledge transformation (e.g., socialization/externalization).

## Source

[[Multiple files (INDEX.md, MAP.md, AGENTS.md, DREAM_THEMES.md)]]

## Why This Matters

Integrating proven KM frameworks could transform Bizing's raw file-based "mind" into a more dynamic, scalable system for innovation, reducing silos between short-term RAM and long-term memory while addressing gaps in knowledge sharing and pattern extraction.
