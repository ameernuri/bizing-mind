# What specific design patterns from Design-for-X methodologies or IBIS-based argumentation could Bizing embed into its ontology to better capture, represent, and resolve the 121 active dissonances and recurring dream themes like

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-22
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 100.0%

## Context

Recurring themes (e.g., "because..." with 66 occurrences) and dissonance folders suggest unstructured pattern tracking; comments reference collisions and associations without formalized ontology.

## Source

[[DREAM_THEMES.md, MAP.md, HEARTBEAT.md]]

## Why This Matters

Formal patterns would enable model-independent taxonomy for Bizing's self-reflection, improving argumentation over tensions (e.g., memory loading conflicts) and turning dream-like recurrences into actionable design knowledge for evolution.
