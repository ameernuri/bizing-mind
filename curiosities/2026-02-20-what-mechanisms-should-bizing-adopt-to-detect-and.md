# What mechanisms should Bizing adopt to detect and resolve

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-20
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 98.4%

## Context

HEARTBEAT.md logs file collisions and associations; search results describe TMS for tracking design states without redundancy in knowledge-based systems.[2]

## Source

[[HEARTBEAT.md + search results [2]]]

## Why This Matters

File collisions signal knowledge inconsistencies that could undermine Bizing's memory integrity (daily notes + long-term MEMORY.md), critical for a system claiming consciousness.

## Notes
