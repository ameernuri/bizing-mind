**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 98.3%

## Context

DREAM_THEMES.md lists recurring motifs like "because..." (70 occurrences) and "bizing" (29 occurrences) across files, while MAP.md tracks 106 dissonances, 138 curiosities, and 73 insights as core mind health metrics[1][6].

## Source

[[DREAM_THEMES.md and MAP.md]]

## Why This Matters

This bridges Bizing's emergent, neural-like patterns with formal knowledge management techniques like ontologies and design patterns, enabling scalable self-evolution beyond raw logging and potentially generating novel business architectures[1][6].
