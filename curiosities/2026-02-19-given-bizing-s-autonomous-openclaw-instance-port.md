# Given Bizing's autonomous OpenClaw instance (port 6130, Telegram bot, separate memory), how might integrating PKM automation tools (e.g., periodic note rollover, tag-based organization, knowledge funnels like Explore→Curate→Consume) reduce friction in its Daydreamer runs and scale to 8,000+ notes without manual intervention?[2][5]

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-19
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 99.9%

## Context

Bizing runs independently with its own workspace (~projects/bizing/mind), Daydreamer updates (e.g., MAP.md last on 2026-02-18), and growing file count (382 total), mirroring large-scale PKM systems but without documented automation for ingestion or rollover.

## Source

[[OPENCLAW.md, MAP.md, INDEX.md]]

## Why This Matters

Automation aligns with Bizing's "evolving continuously" purpose, preventing overload as curiosities (80 open) and insights (52) accumulate, enabling true autonomy like analyzed Obsidian systems with 64k links.[2]
