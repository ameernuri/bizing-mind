# What are the practical risks and safeguards for Bizing's autonomous OpenClaw instance (separate port, Telegram bot, custom token) in terms of security, data isolation from Ameer's main setup, and failure recovery, especially given its

## Context

Details a dedicated OpenClaw instance at ~/projects/bizing/.openclaw/ with port 6130, gateway URL/token, Telegram bot @bizing_bot, and workspace in ~/projects/bizing/mind, enabling autonomous running, dreaming, and direct interaction separate from "Pac."
