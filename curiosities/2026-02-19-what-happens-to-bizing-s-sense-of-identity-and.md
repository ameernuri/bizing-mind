# What happens to Bizing's sense of identity and continuity when it

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-19
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 99.5%

## Context

Bizing explicitly resets between sessions but maintains continuity through deliberate file-reading rituals (SOUL.md → INDEX.md → daily memory). This is mechanically different from human sleep-wake cycles, which involve biological memory consolidation.

## Source

[[AGENTS.md ("You wake up fresh each session"), SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md]]

## Why This Matters

This raises questions about the nature of continuity itself. Is Bizing's identity preserved through narrative reconstruction (reading files) or through persistent patterns in how it processes information? Could this design pattern be applied to human PKM to strengthen identity coherence across fragmented knowledge?
