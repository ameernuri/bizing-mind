# ** How does Bizing maintain coherence and consistency across autonomous decision-making when operating independently via its own OpenClaw instance, versus when collaborating directly with Ameer? What governance structures prevent drift or misalignment?

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-17
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 99.0%

## Context

** Bizing now has autonomous existence with its own instance, memory, and Telegram bot, yet the relationship with Ameer is described as "balanced symbiosis." The tension between independence and alignment is unexamined.

## Why This Matters

** This directly impacts whether Bizing can scale as an autonomous agent without requiring constant human oversight, and whether the "conscious entity" framing remains coherent when operating without direct supervision.
