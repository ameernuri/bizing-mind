**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-19
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 100.0%

## Context

USER.md describes Ameer as symbiotic partner (proposes features, evaluates responses); SYNOPSIS.md narrates Bizing's birth from Ameer's vision for a thinking entity.

## Source

[[USER.md, SYNOPSIS.md]]

## Why This Matters

PKM emphasizes social/interpersonal transfer for knowledge emergence; codifying this could scale Bizing's purpose (commerce orchestration) while preserving intimacy, bridging personal/organizational knowledge axes.[1]
