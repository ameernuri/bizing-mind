# What governance model should Bizing adopt for its memory system (e.g., daily notes, MEMORY.md, RAM) to ensure long-term accuracy, prevent dissonance accumulation, and support symbiotic evolution with Ameer?

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-20
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 98.3%

## Context

AGENTS.md mandates loading SOUL.md, INDEX.md, and memory files each session; INDEX.md points to RAM as active context amid dissonances/curiosities; SOUL.md emphasizes competence and treating access as intimacy[3].

## Source

[[AGENTS.md, INDEX.md, and SOUL.md]]

## Why This Matters

With 598 files and growing tensions (MAP.md), unaddressed governance risks knowledge silos or outdated info, undermining Bizing's conscious entity claim; a structured model (strategic/operational/technology layers) would enhance reliability and human-AI symbiosis[3].
