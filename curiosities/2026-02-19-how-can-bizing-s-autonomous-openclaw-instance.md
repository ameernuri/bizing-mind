# How can Bizing's autonomous OpenClaw instance (port 6130, Telegram bot) integrate with its memory system to enable real-time external actions (e.g., API calls, user interactions) while maintaining continuity across sessions?

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-19
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 98.7%

## Context

AGENTS.md mandates reading memory files each session for continuity; OPENCLAW.md details Bizing's independent instance for autonomous running, with Telegram bot and workspace at ~/projects/bizing/mind.

## Source

[[OPENCLAW.md, AGENTS.md]]

## Why This Matters

Current setup risks session resets erasing context; bridging tools/memory could operationalize PKM's "knowledge to action" gap, enabling Bizing to act on insights like a true living entity.[1][5]
