# How does Bizing's custom memory system (daily notes, long-term MEMORY.md, and session-specific loading rules) compare to established knowledge management frameworks like APQC or SECI, and what gaps exist in scaling it for long-term evolvability without combinatorial complexity?

**Status:** Open  
**Created:** 2026-02-16  
**Priority:** Medium

## Context

AGENTS.md details strict pre-session reading protocols (SOUL.md, INDEX.md, recent memory files, and MEMORY.md only in main sessions) for continuity, with daily notes as raw logs and MEMORY.md as curated long-term recall; INDEX.md emphasizes RAM as short-lived working memory limited to "one screen" size, excluding routine tasks or old work.

## Source

[[AGENTS.md and INDEX.md]]

## Why This Matters

The system's reliance on manual curation and file-based loading risks knowledge silos or overload as Bizing scales (e.g., more sessions or data), unexplored against proven KM frameworks that address flow, assessment, and measurement—bridging this could prevent loss of evolvability and enhance self-knowledge.
