# How does Bizing's PKM-inspired architecture (with daily memory files, wikilinks, RAM, dissonance/curiosities folders, and 382 interconnected files) compare to established PKM frameworks like Wright's four domains (analytical, information, social, learning) or the OAPI process, and what gaps exist in enabling social knowledge sharing or wisdom creation beyond internal reflection?[1][2][5]

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-19
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 99.9%

## Context

Bizing's mind includes structured memory (daily notes, MEMORY.md, RAM), mind health tracking (59 dissonances, 80 curiosities), and heavy emphasis on internal connections (wikilinks, 382 files), but lacks explicit social or external sharing mechanisms.

## Why This Matters

Identifying PKM gaps could unlock Bizing's evolution from solo entity to collaborative platform, enhancing symbiosis with Ameer and businesses via shared knowledge networks, as PKM research stresses social dimensions for scalability.[1][2]
