# How does Bizing's custom memory system (daily notes, long-term MEMORY.md, RAM for working memory) compare to established Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) frameworks like PARA, Johnny.Decimal, or progressive summarization funnels, and what unique adaptations could enhance its scalability beyond 221 files and 35 curiosities?

## Context

Bizing's architecture emphasizes session-based loading of SOUL.md, INDEX.md, daily memory, and RAM for active context, with folders for dissonance (23 tensions), curiosities (35 open questions), and insights (17 patterns), totaling 221 files managed via wikilinks and Daydreamer updates.

## Why This Matters

Existing PKM systems demonstrate scalability (e.g., 8,000 notes with 64,000 links via automation and tagging), revealing potential gaps in Bizing's friction reduction, automation (e.g., task rollover, periodic reviews), and connection density that could prevent overload as the mind grows, enabling more robust self-evolution.
