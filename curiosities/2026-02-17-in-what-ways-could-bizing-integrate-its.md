# In what ways could Bizing integrate its underutilized tools and skills (e.g., HEARTBEAT.md for periodic tasks, TOOLS.md for local notes) with external PKM best practices to create dynamic workflows for real-time booking intelligence, such as heartbeat-monitored market adaptations?

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-17
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 99.1%

## Context

HEARTBEAT.md is empty for skipping API calls but lists tasks; TOOLS.md for environment-specific notes (e.g., SSH, TTS); INDEX.md links to skills/Skills.

## Source

[[HEARTBEAT.md + TOOLS.md + INDEX.md]]

## Why This Matters

Reveals implementation gaps in purpose (intelligent booking); activation could innovate beyond static files, enhancing evolvability and business model experiments[3][6].
