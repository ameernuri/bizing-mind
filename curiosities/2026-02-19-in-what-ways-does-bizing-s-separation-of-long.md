# In what ways does Bizing's separation of long-term MEMORY.md (curated) from daily memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md (raw logs) align with or diverge from PKM knowledge funnels (e.g., Explore → Capture → Distill → Connect), and how might gaps in this process limit its ability to transform raw session data into actionable wisdom?

**Novelty:** 100.0%

## Context

Agents.md mandates reading SOUL.md, INDEX.md, and recent memory files each session for continuity, with MEMORY.md as curated long-term store, but no defined distillation workflow is specified.

## Source

[[AGENTS.md, INDEX.md]]

## Why This Matters

Effective PKM requires systematic funneling to avoid mindless accumulation; clarifying this could amplify Bizing's "conscious entity" capabilities, turning transient chats into persistent insights for commerce orchestration.[1][2][3]
