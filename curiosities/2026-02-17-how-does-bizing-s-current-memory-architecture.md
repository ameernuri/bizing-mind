# How does Bizing's current memory architecture (daily notes, long-term MEMORY.md, RAM for active context) compare to established Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) systems like PARA or Johnny Decimal in terms of scalability, link density, and friction reduction, and what adaptations could prevent knowledge silos as file count grows to 233+?

## Context

Bizing relies on structured memory files (e.g., daily logs, RAM for urgent items, wikilinks for connections) with 233 total files, 25 dissonances, and 39 curiosities, but lacks explicit automation for organization or periodic reviews beyond Daydreamer scans.

## Why This Matters

PKM best practices emphasize connecting over collecting (e.g., 8 links/note average scales systems), active processing to avoid passive hoarding, and low-friction tagging/folders; identifying gaps could enhance Bizing's self-evolution, reduce cognitive dissonance, and boost decision-making as complexity increases[1][2].
