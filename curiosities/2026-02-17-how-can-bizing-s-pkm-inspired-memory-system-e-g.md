# How can Bizing's PKM-inspired memory system (e.g., daily notes, RAM, wikilinks, and periodic reviews) be optimized to handle scaling beyond 178 files, such as automating link density analysis or progressive summarization like high-performing systems with 8,000+ notes?

## Context

Bizing's mind uses structured memory (RAM for active context, daily logs, wikilinks) and tracks 178 files with folders like dissonance/curiosities/insights, but lacks explicit scaling strategies amid growing tensions (19 dissonances, 22 curiosities).

## Why This Matters

Prevents knowledge silos as Bizing evolves into a "living entity," enabling better pattern recognition, reduced friction, and symbiotic growth with Ameer, drawing from proven PKM models that emphasize connections over collection.
