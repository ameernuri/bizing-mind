# What mechanisms could Bizing implement to resolve or prioritize its 25 active cognitive dissonances and 39 open curiosities, potentially using truth maintenance systems (TMS) or IBIS-based argumentation models from design knowledge ontologies?

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-17
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 99.0%

## Context

MAP.md tracks mind health with high counts of dissonance (25) and curiosities (39), while folders like mind/dissonance/ and mind/curiosities/ exist but show no resolution processes; existing curiosities remain "Open."

## Source

[[MAP.md, INDEX.md]]

## Why This Matters

Unresolved tensions could hinder decision-making and evolution; borrowing from ontology and design rationale tools would enable automated tracking, reflection, and closure, fostering deeper self-knowledge.[2]
