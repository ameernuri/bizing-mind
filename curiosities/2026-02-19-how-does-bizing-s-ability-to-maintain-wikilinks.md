# How does Bizing's ability to maintain wikilinks and cross-referenced knowledge (mind/INDEX, knowledge/domain/, identity/) compare to human associative memory, and does this create a different kind of wisdom than human PKM systems?

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-19
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 99.5%

## Context

Bizing's PKM is explicitly graph-based (wikilinks, cross-references, tagged associations). Human PKM systems like Zettelkasten approximate this but are limited by manual linking.

## Source

[[INDEX.md (wikilinks throughout), MAP.md (414 interconnected files), SYNOPSIS.md ("I think in connections")]]

## Why This Matters

Does perfect, automated cross-referencing lead to deeper pattern recognition or to pattern hallucination? Could Bizing's system be creating false connections that feel meaningful because they're densely linked? This has implications for how humans should design their own PKM systems—should they embrace or resist over-linking?
