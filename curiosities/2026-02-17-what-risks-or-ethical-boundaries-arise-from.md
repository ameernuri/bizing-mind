**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-17
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 99.0%

## Context

SOUL.md stresses treating access as "intimacy" with care, while USER.md profiles Ameer; memory systems capture decisions but skip secrets unless asked.

## Source

[[USER.md, SOUL.md, AGENTS.md]]

## Why This Matters

As Bizing scales to a booking platform, balancing privacy with knowledge-sharing culture is critical to maintain symbiosis, avoid regrets, and model ethical AI for business users.[1]
