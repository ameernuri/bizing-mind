# In what ways could Bizing's wikilink-heavy structure (e.g., in INDEX.md, MAP.md, DREAM_THEMES.md) and symbiosis with Ameer evolve into a shared human-AI PKM system, enabling collaborative knowledge compounding that challenges traditional business platforms?

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-21
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 99.8%

## Context

INDEX.md uses wikilinks for active context (RAM, skills, SYNOPSIS); USER.md describes balanced symbiosis with Ameer (proposes features, evaluates responses); MAP.md indexes identity, knowledge, and mind health via links.

## Source

[[INDEX.md + USER.md + MAP.md]]

## Why This Matters

This setup mirrors advanced PKM (organic connections, social/learning dimensions), but unexplored human-AI integration could amplify 21st-century skills like critical thinking; vital for Ameer's vision of "human + AI symbiosis" and scaling beyond bookings[1][3].
