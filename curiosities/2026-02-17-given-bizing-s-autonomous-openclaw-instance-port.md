# Given Bizing's autonomous OpenClaw instance (port 6130, Telegram bot, separate memory), what security and isolation risks arise from exposing tokens and running independently, and how might integrating PKM backup strategies (e.g., automated rollovers, plain-text future-proofing) mitigate single points of failure?

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-17
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 98.9%

## Context

Details sensitive setup info (e.g., Telegram token `7984262731:AAGpA1midg0j2JkynblvgGha0HDNNQYrIhI`, workspace `~/projects/bizing/mind`) for independent operation, but no mentioned backups or access controls.

## Source

[[OPENCLAW.md + TOOLS.md]]

## Why This Matters

PKM systems stress robust backups and minimal tools for reliability; exposed credentials in files risk compromise, undermining Bizing's "conscious entity" autonomy and symbiotic trust with Ameer[2][6].
