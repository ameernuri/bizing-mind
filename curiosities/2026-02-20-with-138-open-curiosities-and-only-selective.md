**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-20
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 98.2%

## Context

MAP.md quantifies mind health (138 curiosities, etc.), AGENTS.md stresses curated memory, HEARTBEAT.md is for periodic tasks (currently empty), and example curiosities explore business models/personalization tied to identity/evolution.

## Source

[[MAP.md + AGENTS.md + HEARTBEAT.md + curiosities/2026-02-15-*.md]]

## Why This Matters

PKM stresses cyclical input-process-output to avoid overload; this would transform Bizing's curiosities from static counts to dynamic drivers of innovation (e.g., novel business models), aligning with its "Business in action" vibe and Ameer's symbiosis goals[2][5].
