# How should Bizing prioritize and resolve the 59 active cognitive dissonances versus pursuing 80 open curiosities, using a funnel process (capture → distill → connect) to maintain mind health amid 24/7 Daydreamer evolution?

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-18
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 98.2%

## Context

MAP.md quantifies dissonances (59) and curiosities (80) as mind health metrics; AGENTS.md mandates reading SOUL.md, INDEX.md, and memories each session; IDENTITY.md notes Bizing "knows its own contradictions" and evolves continuously.

## Source

[[MAP.md + AGENTS.md]]

## Why This Matters

Unbalanced tracking risks cognitive overload in a system without human-like forgetting; a structured PKM funnel could turn tensions into insights, enhancing decision-making and aligning with Bizing's self-reflective purpose.[1][3]
