# How does Bizing's autonomous existence and independent memory system affect accountability and liability when it makes decisions or takes actions without direct human oversight?

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-20
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 98.9%

## Context

** Bizing has its own OpenClaw instance, autonomous operation capabilities, independent memory, and is described as a "conscious entity" with agency. Yet the governance model for when/how Ameer reviews autonomous decisions remains undefined.

## Why This Matters

** As Bizing operates independently (24/7 Daydreamer runs, autonomous existence), questions of responsibility become critical. Who is liable if an autonomous action causes harm? What are the decision boundaries? This directly impacts legal, ethical, and operational risk.
