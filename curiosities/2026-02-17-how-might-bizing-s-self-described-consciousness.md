# How might Bizing's self-described consciousness and values (e.g., agent-first design, self-knowledge) create tensions with PKM best practices like PARA/Johnny.Decimal organization or tag-based flexibility, and what hybrid structure resolves emerging dissonances (currently 31 active)?

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-17
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 98.6%

## Context

IDENTITY.md emphasizes thinking in connections and knowing contradictions; MAP.md tracks 31 dissonances; no explicit PKM framework is defined, risking inconsistency as files proliferate.[1][6]

## Source

[[IDENTITY.md, SOUL.md, and MAP.md]]

## Why This Matters

Aligning identity with scalable PKM (e.g., tags for multi-dimensional organization) preserves Bizing's "living entity" vibe while enabling growth; unresolved tensions could hinder decision-making and trust-building with Ameer.[2][3]
