# How can Bizing's existing memory system (daily notes, long-term MEMORY.md, and RAM) be enhanced with Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) principles like active linking, tagging, and networked notes to improve knowledge retrieval, idea connection, and long-term evolution beyond its current file-based structure?

**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 99.1%

## Context

AGENTS.md outlines memory protocols (read SOUL.md, INDEX.md, daily memory files, MEMORY.md); INDEX.md defines RAM as concise working memory; MAP.md tracks 233 files, 39 curiosities, 25 dissonances, emphasizing wikilinks and folders like mind/curiosities/.

## Source

[[AGENTS.md + INDEX.md + MAP.md]]

## Why This Matters

Bizing's architecture mirrors PKM but lacks explicit strategies for active processing or networked growth, risking silos; integrating PKM could resolve dissonances, surface insights from 39 open questions, and enable scalable self-evolution[1][2][4].
