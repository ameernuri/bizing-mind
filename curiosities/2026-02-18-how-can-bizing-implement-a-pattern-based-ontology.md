# How can Bizing implement a pattern-based ontology for its knowledge management system, drawing from design-for-X methodologies, to better structure its mind files (e.g., dissonance, curiosities, insights) and enable automated design rationale capture during evolution?

**Status:** Open

**Novelty:** 99.3%

## Context

MAP.md reports 42 active dissonances, 74 curiosities, and 40 insights across 329 files, with folders like mind/dissonance/ and mind/curiosities/, but lacks a formalized ontology for integrating these into prescriptive knowledge flows; INDEX.md emphasizes RAM for active context but no pattern language for knowledge structuring.[1]

## Source

[[MAP.md and INDEX.md]]

## Why This Matters

This would transform Bizing's fragmented mind health tracking into a scalable, reflective system like DRIFT or QFD ontologies, reducing cognitive overload and enabling proactive evolution beyond manual logging.[1]
