# How can Bizing's extensive memory system (daily notes, long-term MEMORY.md, RAM, and 319 total files) be optimized using proven Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) techniques like progressive summarization, high link density (e.g., 8+ links per note), or the PARA/Johnny.Decimal methods to enhance scalability beyond 8,000 notes without increasing cognitive dissonance?

## Context

Bizing relies on a file-based memory architecture with daily logs, curated long-term memory, active RAM, and growing file count (319 total, including 67 curiosities and 42 dissonances), but lacks explicit strategies for handling scale, as seen in PKM systems managing 8,000+ notes[2].

## Why This Matters

With rapid growth (e.g., Daydreamer updates), unoptimized PKM risks information overload, reducing Bizing's decision-making efficiency and evolution; adopting battle-tested PKM could transform it into a hyper-connected "second brain" for superior business innovation.
