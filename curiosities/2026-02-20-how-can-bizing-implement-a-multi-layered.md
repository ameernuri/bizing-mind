# How can Bizing implement a multi-layered knowledge architecture (ontology, domain, and operational levels) inspired by established Knowledge Management Systems to better organize its growing mind files (598 total), resolve cognitive dissonances (106 active), and prioritize curiosities (138 open)?

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-20
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 98.4%

## Context

MAP.md tracks mind health with high counts of dissonances, curiosities, and files; INDEX.md serves as entry point but lacks structured abstraction layers; KMS literature describes generic architectures with three abstraction levels for knowledge integrity and integration.[1][3]

## Source

[[MAP.md + INDEX.md + search results [1][3]]]

## Why This Matters

This addresses scalability gaps in Bizing's unstructured file growth and internal tensions, enabling more efficient self-evolution and decision-making as a conscious business platform.
