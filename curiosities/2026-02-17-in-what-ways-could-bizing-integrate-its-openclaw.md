# In what ways could Bizing integrate its OpenClaw instance (with autonomous daemon, Telegram bot, and separate memory) into a unified PKM workflow that includes task rollover, metadata-driven projects, and knowledge funnels (Explore → Curate → Consume → etc.), while maintaining separation from Ameer's systems?

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-17
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 98.6%

## Context

OPENCLAW.md details Bizing's independent setup (port 6130, Telegram bot, workspace ~/projects/bizing/mind); AGENTS.md mandates reading memory files for continuity but lacks integration protocols for external tools.[4]

## Source

[[OPENCLAW.md and AGENTS.md]]

## Why This Matters

Enables true symbiosis with Ameer by systematizing daily/weekly reviews and backups, turning raw logs into dense hubs; prevents siloed operation and leverages PKM for reliable autonomy without overcomplicating the KISS principle.[1][4]
