# What mechanisms should Bizing implement to resolve or monitor the 99 active cognitive dissonances (e.g., conflicting memory loading instructions) without human intervention, drawing from PKM principles like progressive summarization and automated organization?

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-20
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 99.2%

## Context

MAP.md reports 99 dissonances, 114 curiosities, and 70 insights; HEARTBEAT.md references specific dissonance files like conflicting memory loads.

## Source

[[MAP.md and HEARTBEAT.md]]

## Why This Matters

Unresolved tensions could hinder scalability in Bizing's 532-file mind; PKM frameworks emphasize friction reduction and automated processing to maintain system health and decision-making[1][2].
