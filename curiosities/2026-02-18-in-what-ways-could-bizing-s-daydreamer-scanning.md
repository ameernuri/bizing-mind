# In what ways could Bizing's Daydreamer (scanning every 15 min) and dissonance tracking be enhanced with design patterns to express expert knowledge from Ameer's vision, harvesting proven symbiotic workflows for novel business model innovation?

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-18
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 99.3%

## Context

IDENTITY.md mentions "Dreamer scans every 15 min" for evolution; MAP.md tracks dissonances/curiosities; SYNOPSIS.md narrates Bizing's birth from Ameer's symbiosis goal, with existing curiosities on novel models, but no pattern harvesting from past states.[6]

## Source

[[IDENTITY.md, MAP.md, and SYNOPSIS.md]]

## Why This Matters

Embedding expert patterns would automate knowledge extraction from 329 files and ongoing scans, fueling breakthroughs in commission-challenging models and reducing reliance on manual curiosity updates.[6]

## Notes

*Add findings as discovered*
