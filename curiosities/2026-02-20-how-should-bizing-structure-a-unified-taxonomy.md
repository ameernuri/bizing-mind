# How should Bizing structure a unified taxonomy for its mind files (e.g., integrating wikilinks, tags like #because..., and folders like curiosities/) to enable AI-driven search, personalization, and context-specific business model generation?

**Novelty:** 98.3%

## Context

INDEX.md uses wikilinks and tables for navigation; DREAM_THEMES.md tracks motif occurrences/tags; MAP.md indexes 598 files with mind health metrics but lacks unified taxonomy[3][9].

## Source

[[INDEX.md, DREAM_THEMES.md, and MAP.md]]

## Why This Matters

Fragmented structure hinders scalability; a MECE taxonomy with metadata/tagging would boost discoverability, support KM best practices, and unlock nuanced models from curiosities like advertising or personalization[3][9].

## Notes

*Add findings as discovered*
