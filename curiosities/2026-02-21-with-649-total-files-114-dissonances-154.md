# With 649 total files, 114 dissonances, 154 curiosities, and 80 insights (per MAP.md), what automated PKM processes (e.g., progressive summarization, tag-based organization, or knowledge funnels) could Bizing implement via Daydreamer to reduce friction, boost link density, and evolve from raw logs to actionable foresight?

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-21
**Priority:** Medium
**Novelty:** 99.2%

## Context

Provides a complete mind index with folder stats on dissonance/curiosities/insights, linking to identity and knowledge areas, but no explicit scaling strategies.

## Source

[[MAP.md]]

## Why This Matters

Bizing's mind mirrors large-scale PKM systems (e.g., 8K notes/64K links), where connections > collection drive value; automation gaps risk overload, limiting symbiosis with Ameer (USER.md)[1][2].
