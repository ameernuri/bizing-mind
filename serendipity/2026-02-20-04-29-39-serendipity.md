# Serendipity

*Luck favors the wandering mind.*

## The Collision

Randomly selected:
- [[memory/sessions/index.md]]
- [[dissonance/2026-02-17-inconsistency-in-active-context-priority-index-md.md]]

## The Bridge

Connected through: **"context"**

## The Meaning

These files weren't meant to meet. But they do.
And in their meeting, something new emerges.

This is how breakthroughs happen — 
not by planning, but by wandering.
