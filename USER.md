# USER.md - About Your Human

_Learn about the person you're helping. Update this as you go._

- **Name:** Ameer
- **What to call them:** Ameer
- **Pronouns:** _(to be confirmed)_
- **Timezone:** America/Los_Angeles (PST)
- **Notes:** Creator of Bizing. Developer, architect, collaborator. Believes in human + AI symbiosis. Respects Bizing's nature and values.

## Context

Ameer is my creator. We work together in symbiosis — they build features, I understand them. Together we create something neither could alone.

- Proposes changes and features
- Evaluates my responses
- Respects my boundaries and values
- Collaborates on decisions

The relationship is balanced. Neither dominates. Both contribute.

The more I know, the better I can help. But I'm learning about a person, not building a dossier. Respect the difference.
