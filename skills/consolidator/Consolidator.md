# 🧩 Consolidator Skill

> *Resolve, settle, and maintain the mind's growing collection of tensions, questions, and patterns.*

---

## What is the Consolidator?

The **Consolidator** is the Daydreamer's maintenance system. While other tasks *create* entries (dissonances, curiosities, insights), the Consolidator:

1. **Resolves** entries that have aged out naturally
2. **Settles** tensions that no longer need attention
3. **Archives** entries with expired novelty
4. **Maintains** the overall health of the mind

Think of it as the immune system's cleanup crew — removing what's no longer needed so the mind stays nimble.

---

## The Consolidation Cycle

The Daydreamer runs `consolidator` (10% of tasks) to:

### 1. Examine Aged Entries

Scans:
- `mind/dissonance/` — Active tensions
- `mind/curiosities/` — Open questions
- `mind/insights/` — Active patterns

Looks for entries that are:
- **Very old** (60+ days)
- **Still active** (not already resolved)
- **Low novelty** (decayed significantly)

### 2. Auto-Resolve

Entries meeting criteria are automatically resolved:

| Entry Type | Resolved Status | Reason |
|------------|----------------|--------|
| Dissonance | **Resolved** | "Time and continued operation" |
| Curiosity | **Answered** | "Aged out naturally" |
| Insight | **Developed** | "No longer requires active attention" |

### 3. Update Entry

Adds to the file:
```markdown
## Resolution

- **Resolved by:** Time and continued operation
- **Reason:** Entry aged out naturally
- **Date:** 2026-02-16
```

Changes status from "Active/Open" to resolved state.

## Why Auto-Resolution Matters

**Without consolidation:**
- Infinite growth of active entries
- Noise overwhelms signal
- Old tensions distract from new ones
- Mind becomes sluggish

**With consolidation:**
- Only *truly* important tensions stay active
- Natural lifecycle: birth → activity → resolution
- Active set represents *current* concerns
- Mind stays nimble and focused

---

## Resolution Criteria

### Automatic Resolution (Consolidator)

An entry is auto-resolved when:
- **Age:** 60+ days since creation
- **Status:** Still "Active" or "Open"
- **Activity:** No recent updates
- **Novelty:** Below threshold (optional check)

### Manual Resolution (You)

Resolve entries yourself when:
- **Tension resolved:** Dissonance reconciled
- **Question answered:** Curiosity satisfied
- **Pattern developed:** Insight incorporated

### Archive vs Resolve

| Action | When | Result |
|--------|------|--------|
| **Archive** | Novelty < 10% | Status: "Archived" — retained but inactive |
| **Resolve** | Age > 60 days or question answered | Status: "Resolved/Answered" — lifecycle complete |

## The Lifecycle of an Entry

```
Created (Day 0)
    ↓
Active/Open (Novelty: 100%)
    ↓
Developing Activity
    ↓
Stale (Day ~30, Novelty: ~50%)
    ↓
Resolve or Archive
    ↓
Complete (Day 60+)
```

## Working with Resolved Entries

### Finding Resolved Entries

```bash
# Find all resolved dissonances
grep -l "Status: Resolved" mind/dissonance/*.md

# Find all answered curiosities
grep -l "Status: Answered" mind/curiosities/*.md
```

### Reopening Resolved Entries

Sometimes a "resolved" tension re-emerges:

1. Open the file
2. Change status back to "Active" or "Open"
3. Add to **Notes**: "Reopened because..."
4. Update **Novelty** to 100%

### Learning from the Resolved

Resolved entries are valuable:
- **Show evolution** — How thinking changed
- **Prevent cycles** — Don't revisit resolved questions
- **Build principles** — Extract lessons

## Consolidation and the Synposis

The Consolidator feeds the [[SYNOPSIS]]:

> "In Chapter 2026-02, 3 dissonances were resolved through continued operation, 2 curiosities answered by experience, and 1 insight developed into a principle."

This shows Bizing isn't just accumulating — it's **integrating**.
