# Link Everything

*Every code mention gets a link.*

---

## Rule

❌ **Don't:** "The schema file needs updating"
✅ **Do:** "[[../../../bizing/packages/db/schema.ts|The schema]] needs updating"

---

## Why

1. **Navigation** — Click to jump to file
2. **Context** — See file in Obsidian graph
3. **Memory** — Files connected to ideas
4. **Mobile** — Path visible in text

---

## How

**Format:** `[[../../../bizing/packages/db/schema.ts|Display Name]]`

**From brain location:** `~/projects/bizing/brain/`
**To code:** `~/projects/bizing/`

**Path reference:**
- `[[../../../bizing/apps/api/src/routes.ts|Routes]]`
- `[[../../../bizing/packages/db/schema.ts|Schema]]`

---

## When to Link

- [x] Every file mentioned
- [x] Every function referenced
- [x] Every module discussed
- [x] Every change documented

**If in doubt, link it.**
