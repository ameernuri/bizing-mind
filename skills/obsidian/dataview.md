# 🔍 Dataview Skill

> Query and display your mind data dynamically

---

## What is Dataview?

[[Dataview plugin]] is a **live index and query engine** for your Obsidian vault. It reads metadata from your notes and lets you query
  - filter
  - sort
  - and display that data in real-time.

**Key capability:** Your queries stay **always up to date** — when you change a file
  - the query result updates automatically.

---

## Data Indexing

Dataview can only query **indexed data**:

### Automatically Indexed (Implicit Fields)
- `file.name` — Note name
- `file.path` — Full path
- `file.folder` — Parent folder
- `file.tags` — All #tags
- `file.inlinks` — Notes linking to this
- `file.outlinks` — Notes this links to
- `file.ctime` — Created time
- `file.mtime` — Modified time
- `file.size` — File size
- `file.tasks` — All tasks in file

### Manual Metadata (Frontmatter)
Add YAML at top of file:
```yaml
---
author: "Ameer"
date: 2026-02-13
priority: high
tags: 
  - daily
  - standup
---
```

### Inline Fields
Add anywhere in content:
```markdown
From [author:: Ameer]
  - created on (date:: 2026-02-13)

This is #priority::high work.
```

---

## Query Types

### 1. LIST — Simple list of files
```dataview
LIST
FROM "mind/symbiosis"
WHERE file.tags
```

### 2. TABLE — Columns of data
```dataview
TABLE file.ctime AS "Created"
  - file.tags AS "Tags"
FROM "mind/memory/sessions"
SORT file.ctime DESC
LIMIT 10
```

### 3. TASK — Task lists
```dataview
TASK
FROM "mind"
WHERE !completed
SORT priority ASC
```

### 4. CALENDAR — Date-based view
```dataview
CALENDAR file.ctime
FROM "mind/memory/sessions"
```

---

## Essential Data Commands

### FROM — Select source
```dataview
LIST
FROM "mind/symbiosis"           # Folder
FROM #daily                       # Tag
FROM [[INDEX]]                    # Linked from
FROM "mind" AND #task             # Combined
```

### WHERE — Filter results
```dataview
LIST
FROM "mind"
WHERE file.tags AND contains(file.tags
  - "#critical")
WHERE date = date(today)
WHERE priority = "high"
WHERE !completed
```

### SORT — Order results
```dataview
LIST
FROM "mind/memory/sessions"
SORT file.ctime DESC              # Newest first
SORT priority ASC                 # Priority order
```

### LIMIT — Restrict count
```dataview
LIST
FROM "mind/memory/sessions"
SORT file.ctime DESC
LIMIT 5                           # Only 5 most recent
```

### GROUP BY — Organize by field
```dataview
TABLE rows.file.name AS "Files"
FROM "mind"
GROUP BY file.folder
```

## Common Functions

### Date Functions
```dataview
date(today)           # Current date
date(now)             # Current datetime
date(2026-02-13)      # Specific date
file.ctime.year       # Extract year
date(now) - file.ctime # Time difference
```

### String Functions
```dataview
contains(file.tags
  - "#critical")
startsWith(file.name
  - "2026-02")
endsWith(file.path
  - "standup.md")
regexmatch("pattern"
  - file.name)
```

### List Operations
```dataview
length(file.tags)              # Count tags
sum(file.size)                 # Total size
max(file.ctime)                # Most recent
min(file.ctime)                # Oldest
filter(file.tags
  - (t) => contains(t
  - "#"))
```

## Real-World Examples

### Today's Tasks
```dataview
TASK
FROM "mind/symbiosis"
WHERE contains(tags
  - "#today") AND !completed
SORT priority ASC
```

### Recent Sessions
```dataview
TABLE file.ctime AS "Date"
  - file.tags AS "Tags"
FROM "mind/memory/sessions"
SORT file.ctime DESC
LIMIT 5
```

### Orphaned Files (No Links)
```dataview
LIST
FROM "mind"
WHERE length(file.inlinks) = 0
AND file.path != "mind/INDEX"
AND file.path != "mind/MAP"
```

### Blockers
```dataview
TASK
FROM "mind"
WHERE contains(tags
  - "#blocker") AND !completed
```

### Open Tasks by Priority
```dataview
TASK
FROM "mind"
WHERE !completed
GROUP BY priority
```

### Files Modified Today
```dataview
LIST
FROM "mind"
WHERE file.mtime >= date(today)
SORT file.mtime DESC
```

### Notes Without Tags (for cleanup)
```dataview
LIST
FROM "mind"
WHERE !file.tags
```

### All Kanban Tasks
```dataview
TASK
FROM "mind/workspace"
WHERE !completed
SORT priority DESC
```

## Inline Queries

For single values anywhere in text:

```markdown
Total open tasks: `= length(filter(file.tasks
  - (t) => !t.completed))`

Today is: `= date(today)`

Files updated today: `= length(filter(this.file.inlinks
  - (f) => f.mtime >= date(today)))`
```

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Tags for Categories
```yaml
---
tags: 
  - task
  - critical
  - api
---
```

### 2. Use Frontmatter for Structured Data
```yaml
---
status: in-progress
priority: high
assignee: ameer
due: 2026-02-15
---
```

### 3. Be Specific with FROM
Don't query entire vault — scope to relevant folders:
```dataview
FROM "mind/symbiosis"     # Good
FROM "mind"               # Okay
FROM ""                   # Slow on large vaults
```

### 4. Index What You Query
Dataview only sees:
- Frontmatter YAML
- Inline [key:: value] fields
- Implicit fields (file.*
  - tags
  - tasks)

Regular text paragraphs are NOT indexed.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Query not updating | Dataview refreshes automatically; force with `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Dataview: Rebuild Vault Cache" |
| Field not showing | Check if it's in frontmatter or inline format |
| Empty results | Check FROM path exists; check WHERE conditions aren't too strict |
| Slow queries | Narrow FROM scope; add LIMIT |
| Date errors | Use `date(YYYY-MM-DD)` format |
