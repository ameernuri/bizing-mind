# 🧠 RAM Skill — Working Memory

> How to use and maintain the [[mind/memory/RAM|Bizing's working memory]]

---

## ⚡ IMPORTANT: Use RAM Every Time

**Before any work with the mind:**

1. Read [[mind/memory/RAM]] ← Active context ← **START HERE**
2. Read [[mind/INDEX]] — Entry point
3. Read [[symbiosis/feedback]] — Learnings
4. Do work
5. Update RAM if context changed

**RAM is the first thing to read when interacting with the mind.**

---

## What Is RAM?

**RAM = Working Memory** — the active, immediate context of the mind.

Think of it like a computer's RAM:
- **Fast access** — What's important right now
- **Active processes** — What we're working on now
- **Limited space** — Keep it tight, focused
- **Temporary** — When done, archive or purge

**RAM is NOT:**
- ❌ A log (use `memory/sessions/` for logs)
- ❌ A changelog (use `evolution/` for that)
- ❌ A dump of everything

**RAM IS:**
- ✅ Active focus — What we're working on NOW
- ✅ Current context — What matters RIGHT NOW
- ✅ Urgent items — What needs attention NOW
- ✅ Recent completed — What we just finished (keep brief)

---

## The Rule

> RAM contains only what matters **right now**.
> 
> If it's not actively being worked on or important in this moment, it doesn't belong in RAM.

## Structure

```
[[mind/memory/RAM|RAM.md]]
├── ## 🎯 Active Focus      ← What we're working on RIGHT NOW
│   └── Primary task
│       └── Subtasks
├── ## 🚨 Urgencies         ← Needs immediate attention
├── ## ✅ Recent Completed   ← Just finished (keep brief, 48h max)
├── ## 🔄 In Progress       ← Currently doing
└── ## ⏸️ Blockers         ← Stuck on something
```

## Usage

### When to Write to RAM

**Add when:**
- Starting new work that matters NOW
- Something needs urgent attention
- Just completed something important (keep brief)
- Blockers that are slowing work NOW
- Context that must not be lost

**Don't add:**
- Routine tasks
- Completed work from >48h ago
- Things that can be looked up elsewhere
- Everything — be selective

### When to Remove from RAM

**Remove when:**
- Task is complete → archive if significant
- Item is >48h old
- Context is no longer relevant
- Blockers are resolved

**Rule:** RAM should fit on one screen. If it's getting long, archive.
