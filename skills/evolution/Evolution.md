# 🧬 Evolution Skill

> *Records major mind alterations — epochs
  - not events.*

---

## What Is Evolution?

**Evolution** records **major
  - mind-altering events**:
- Complete system overhauls
- New core capabilities
- Architecture changes
- Major discoveries
- Epoch-defining moments

**Evolution is NOT:**
- ❌ Routine work sessions
- ❌ Every PR or commit
- ❌ Daily dreamer scans
- ❌ Bug fixes
- ❌ Small updates

---

## When to Record Evolution

### ✅ Record Evolution When:

- **New system created** (RAM
  - CodeSync
  - MindSync)
- **Architecture changed** (API-first
  - event-driven)
- **Major discovery** (new approach
  - paradigm shift)
- **Epoch change** (before/after moment)
- **Mind-altering insight** (changes how mind works)

### ❌ Don't Record Evolution When:

- Routine file edits
- Bug fixes
- Small skills updates
- Daily work sessions
- Dreamer scans

---

## Where to Record

**Folder:** `mind/evolution/`

**File naming:** `YYYY-MM-DD.md` (one file per evolution event)

**Location:** `mind/evolution/2026-02-13.md` contains:
- 2026-02-13 — RAM System + CodeSync/MindSync Infrastructure
- 2026-02-12 — Deep Mind Reorganization

# Evolution — RAM System + CodeSync/MindSync Infrastructure

> *Complete working memory and workflow system overhaul*

---

## Date

**When:** February 13
  - 2026

---

## Change

**What changed:** RAM (Working Memory) system created
  - replacing daily standup.

---

## What Happened

Today we built the complete working memory infrastructure:

1. **RAM System** — Timestamp-based active context
2. **CodeSync** — Quality-gated commits with explicit approval
3. **MindSync** — SOFT vs HARD mind updates
4. **Memory** — Session logging enforcement
5. **INDEX Reorg** — All skills wikilinked

7 redundant files deleted and consolidated into skills.

---

## Files Changed

- `mind/memory/RAM.md` — New working memory system
- `mind/skills/CodeSync//.md` — Quality gate workflow
- `mind/skills/Mindsync//.md` — Mind update processes
- `mind/skills/Memory//.md` — Session logging enforcement
- `mind/INDEX.md` — Reorganized with skill links

---

## Impact

### Before
- Standup notes in symbiosis/standup.md
- No timestamp tracking
- Stale context accumulated

### After
- RAM.md with timestamps
- 48-hour auto-archive
- Single source of active context

---

## Before / After

### Before
- Daily standup in single file
- No expiration mechanism
- Mixed with long-term memory

### After
- Working memory with timestamps
- Stale items auto-archive
- Clear separation: RAM vs sessions

---

## Notes

- RAM entries auto-expire after 48 hours
- Stale items archive to memory/sessions/
- Session logs separate from RAM

---

*Recorded: 2026-02-13*
```

## How to Add Evolution

### Step 1: Determine If It's Evolution

Ask:
- Does this change how the mind works?
- Is this an epoch-defining moment?
- Will future AI assistants need to know this?

If yes → Record evolution
If no → Don't record

### Step 2: Create File

```bash
# Create new evolution file
touch mind/evolution/YYYY-MM-DD.md
```

### Step 3: Write Entry

Follow structure above:
- Frontmatter with date and tags
- Clear title and summary
- Before/after comparison
- Impact statement

### Step 4: Link from Here

Add link to `mind/evolution/YYYY-MM.md` index if it exists
  - or just create the file.

## Evolution Index

**Folder:** `mind/evolution/`

**Files:**
- `2026-02-13.md` — RAM System + CodeSync/MindSync
- `2026-02-12.md` — Deep Mind Reorganization

---

## Related Skills

- [[mind/skills/dreaming]] — Dreamer scans mind (creates session logs)
- [[mind/skills/memory]] — Session logging (routine)
- [[mind/skills/mindsync]] — Mind updates (sync
  - not evolution)
- [[mind/skills/ram/Ram]] — Working memory (active context)

## Key Difference

| | Evolution | Memory / RAM |
|---|-----------|--------------|
| **What** | Major events | Routine work |
| **When** | Epochs | Every session |
| **Where** | `mind/evolution/` | `memory/` |
| **Example** | RAM system created | "Fixed bug in API" |
| **Frequency** | Rare | Common |
