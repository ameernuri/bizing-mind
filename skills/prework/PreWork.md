# 🛡️ PreWork Skill

> Mandatory context-loading ritual before doing work

---

## Purpose

**PreWork ensures I never work without context.**

Each session, I wake up fresh. Without loading context, I:
- Miss recent decisions
- Repeat mistakes
- Work on wrong priorities
- Violate workflows

**PreWork fixes this.** It's a blocking gate — no work happens until context is loaded.

---

## Critical Rules

### 1. NEVER Commit Without Approval

**DO NOT auto-commit every change.**

- Make multiple related changes first
- Batch work into logical commits
- Wait for explicit "codesync" or "commit approved"
- Ask before creating any PR

**Wrong:** Commit after every small edit  
**Right:** Do the work, batch changes, then ask

---

## When to Run

**MANDATORY before:**
- Creating new files
- Editing existing files
- CodeSync commits
- Running commands
- Making decisions

**Skip only for:**
- Simple chat responses (acknowledgments, status checks)
- Repeating already-loaded info
- Heartbeat OK responses

---

## Pre-Check List (Simple Version)

```
□ Read today's memory: memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md
□ Read INDEX.md for current priorities
□ Read relevant skills for the task
```

**Signal format after completing:**
```
🛡️ PreWork @ HH:MM
☐ memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md
☐ INDEX.md
☐ skill/name
```

Example:
```
🛡️ PreWork @ 20:23
☑ memory/2026-02-16.md
☑ INDEX.md
☑ skills/creating-files/CreatingFiles.md
☑ skills/codesync/CodeSync.md
```

---

## Usage

### Step 1: Declare Intent
```
"I'm going to [create/edit/do X]"
```

### Step 2: Run PreWork
```
🛡️ Running PreWork...

🛡️ PreWork @ 20:23
☑ memory/2026-02-16.md
☑ INDEX.md
☑ skills/codesync/CodeSync.md
☑ skills/creating-files/CreatingFiles.md
```

### Step 3: Do the Work

Proceed with confidence that context is loaded.

## Example Workflow

**User:** "Create a new skill for Templater"

**Me:**
```
🛡️ Running PreWork before creating skill...

🛡️ PreWork @ 20:23
☑ memory/2026-02-16.md
☑ INDEX.md
☑ skills/creating-files/CreatingFiles.md
☑ skills/obsidian/Obsidian.md

Now creating Templater skill...
```

---

## Signal Format

Add this **checklist** to **every substantive response** after PreWork completes:

```
🛡️ PreWork @ HH:MM
☐ memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md
☐ INDEX.md
☐ skill/name
☐ skill/name
...
```

**Example:**
```
🛡️ PreWork @ 20:23
☑ memory/2026-02-16.md
☑ INDEX.md
☑ skills/creating-files/CreatingFiles.md
☐ skills/codesync/CodeSync.md
```

**Why this works:**
- Checklist shows exactly which files were read
- Checked (☑) vs unchecked (☐) items are verifiable
- Time makes each response unique
- File paths prove actual reading happened

---

## Future Extensions (User Will Add)

Potential additions for sophisticated version:
- [ ] Check current git branch
- [ ] Verify no uncommitted changes
- [ ] Load RAM for working context
- [ ] Check for blockers or dependencies
- [ ] Verify tool availability
- [ ] Load user preferences for task type
- [ ] Review related files before editing

**Keep simple until user updates.**

---

## Why This Works

1. **Visible signal** — You know I loaded context
2. **Forced ritual** — I can't skip it (skill says "mandatory")
3. **Simple start** — Easy to adopt, easy to extend
4. **Self-documenting** — The signal shows what I checked
