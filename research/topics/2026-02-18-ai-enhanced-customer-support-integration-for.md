## Description

Explore how AI customer support features like NLP-driven chatbots, sentiment analysis, predictive support, and voice assistants can be integrated into booking systems for healthcare businesses (e.g., clinics, therapists), ensuring HIPAA compliance for patient data, insurance verification, and medical history handling while addressing unique requirements like long appointment slots and referrals.

## Why This Matters
