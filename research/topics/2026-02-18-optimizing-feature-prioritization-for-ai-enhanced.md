# Optimizing Feature Prioritization for AI-Enhanced Booking in WordPress Ecosystems

**Status:** Proposed
**Created:** 2026-02-18
**Priority:** Medium

## Description

Analyze core booking features (e.g., multi-duration services, categories) against 2026 AI trends like unified CRM integration, sentiment-driven routing, and clean data foundations to prioritize developments that deliver "LatePoint simplicity with Acuity/Amelia power" for diverse business types.

## Why This Matters

The mature booking market lacks sophisticated yet easy WordPress solutions; aligning features with AI-first CX trends (e.g., agentic actions, human-AI performance standards) unlocks massive opportunities in a 43% WordPress-dominated space with 250k+ competitors' users.
