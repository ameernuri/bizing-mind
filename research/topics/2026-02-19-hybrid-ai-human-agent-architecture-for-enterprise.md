# Hybrid AI-Human Agent Architecture for Enterprise Booking Platform Support

**Status:** Proposed
**Created:** 2026-02-19
**Priority:** Medium

## Description

Examine how "Connected Rep" technology and AI agent assist tools can enhance customer support for enterprise booking platform users. Research the optimal balance between AI automation (handling routine inquiries, ticket routing, knowledge base retrieval) and human agent intervention (complex issues, relationship-building, judgment calls). Develop a framework for implementing this hybrid model that improves contact center efficiency by up to 30% while maintaining the human touch customers value.

## Why This Matters

Your market research identifies a gap for platforms combining "LatePoint simplicity with Acuity/Amelia power." The search results show that 65% of businesses plan to expand AI in customer support by 2026[2], and Connected Rep technology will improve contact center efficiency by 30%[2]. However, AI-only solutions miss the mark[5]—the winning approach is human-centric AI. This topic directly supports Bizet's competitive positioning by defining how to deliver superior customer support at scale.
