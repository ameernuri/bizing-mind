# Optimizing Booking Feature Prevalence with AI-Driven Personalization and Self-Service

**Status:** Proposed
**Created:** 2026-02-18
**Priority:** Medium

## Description

Investigate mapping core booking features (e.g., service categories, multiple durations) against AI enhancements like knowledge base search, voice assistants, and self-service evolution to prioritize development for diverse business types, focusing on WordPress compatibility and competitive gaps between simple plugins and enterprise tools.[1][2]

## Why This Matters

Platforms lacking sophisticated yet easy-to-use AI support risk losing to extremes in the market (e.g., LatePoint vs. Amelia); aligning features with 2026 trends like AI personalization boosts adoption among 43% WordPress sites and high-volume users of competitors.[3]
