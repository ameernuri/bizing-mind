**Created:** 2026-02-17
**Priority:** Medium

## Description

Analyze how emerging AI capabilities (e.g., conversational agents, agent assist tools, connected rep technology) map to core booking features like service scheduling, multiple durations, and categories, identifying gaps in competitors like LatePoint/Amelia for WordPress ecosystems.

## Why This Matters

Market research highlights demand for "simplicity with power"; aligning features with AI trends (e.g., $80B cost savings, 30% efficiency gains) enables Bizet to target 43% WordPress market share and diverse businesses like healthcare.[1][3][5]
