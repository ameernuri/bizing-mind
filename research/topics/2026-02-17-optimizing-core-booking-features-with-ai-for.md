## Description

Investigate adaptations of universal booking features (e.g., service definitions, multiple durations, categories) using AI capabilities like intent recognition, knowledge base search, and voice assistants to meet unique requirements across business types (healthcare, salons, etc.), targeting the gap for easy-to-use, powerful WordPress plugins amid 2026 AI trends in agent assistance and omnichannel support.
