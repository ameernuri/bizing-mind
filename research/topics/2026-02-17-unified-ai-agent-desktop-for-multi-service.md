# Unified AI Agent Desktop for Multi-Service Booking Platforms

**Status:** Proposed
**Created:** 2026-02-17
**Priority:** Medium

## Description

Examine how agentic AI and Large Action Models (LAMs) can replace fragmented booking platform interfaces by creating a single, unified agent workspace. Focus on designing AI-assisted workflows that help booking administrators intelligently route customer inquiries, manage multi-service scheduling conflicts, and handle complex requests (referrals, insurance verification, service customization) without requiring navigation across multiple disconnected tools.

## Why This Matters

Current booking platforms force administrators to juggle tabs and systems in real-time, creating operational friction. By consolidating AI-assisted routing, knowledge retrieval, and decision-making into one interface, platforms can reduce handle time (demonstrated 6% reduction in banking), lower training requirements, and enable administrators to focus on complex customer interactions rather than system navigation—directly addressing the market gap for "professional-grade capabilities with exceptional ease of use."
