# Vertical-Specific AI Support Requirements: Healthcare Booking as a Case Study

**Status:** Proposed
**Created:** 2026-02-18
**Priority:** Medium

## Description

Examine how AI customer support must adapt to industry-specific constraints, using healthcare booking as the primary case study. Healthcare requires HIPAA compliance, insurance verification, medical history management, and referral handling[from provided files]—all areas where AI errors carry serious consequences. Research how agentic AI can safely automate narrow, well-defined tasks (appointment confirmations, insurance pre-verification) while maintaining human oversight for sensitive interactions. Analyze the gap between generic AI support solutions and vertical-specific needs, and develop a framework for implementing compliant, trustworthy AI in regulated industries.

## Why This Matters

The booking platform market serves diverse verticals with vastly different compliance and trust requirements. Healthcare alone represents a substantial addressable market within the 100,000+ LatePoint users and 90,000+ Amelia customers. AI hallucinations and errors in customer support are documented challenges[1], but they pose existential risks in healthcare contexts. A booking platform that solves vertical-specific AI implementation—particularly for healthcare—would establish a defensible competitive moat.
