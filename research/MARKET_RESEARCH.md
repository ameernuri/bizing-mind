# Bizet Market Research Report

## Booking Platform Competitive Analysis

**Generated:** February 7, 2026
**Prepared for:** Bizet Development Team

---

## Executive Summary

The online booking platform market is mature but underserved in key areas. Existing solutions tend toward two extremes: enterprise-grade systems with steep learning curves and feature bloat, or simple plugins lacking sophistication. This creates a significant opportunity for a platform that delivers professional-grade capabilities with exceptional ease of use.

**Key Finding:** The market wants "LatePoint simplicity" with "Acuity/Amelia power." There is a massive gap in the market for a WordPress-native booking solution that combines LatePoint's ease of use, Amelia's comprehensive feature set, and competitive pricing.

**Market Opportunity:**

- WordPress powers 43% of all websites (huge addressable market)
- 70,000+ businesses use Bookly alone
- 100,000+ websites use LatePoint
- 90,000+ customers for Amelia
- 250,000+ customers for Acuity Scheduling
- Millions still using phone/email booking (huge conversion opportunity)
