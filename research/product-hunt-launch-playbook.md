# The Complete Product Hunt Launch Playbook

## Executive Summary

Product Hunt is the premier platform for launching tech products to an engaged community of early adopters, founders, investors, and makers. A successful launch can drive thousands of signups, attract investor attention, and create lasting visibility.

**Key Stats:**
- 5M+ monthly active users
- 100K+ products launched
- Average #1 product gets 1,000-3,000+ upvotes
- Top 5 products typically get 500-1,500 upvotes
- Launches happen daily at 12:01 AM PT

---

## Phase 1: Pre-Launch Preparation (4-6 Weeks Before)

### 1.1 Build Your Product Hunt Profile

**Create a Strong Hunter/Maker Profile:**
- Use a clear, professional headshot
- Write a compelling bio highlighting your expertise
- Link to your Twitter, LinkedIn, and personal website
- Engage with the community before your launch (comment, upvote, support others)

**Why this matters:** Product Hunt's algorithm favors accounts with history and engagement. Cold accounts launching get less visibility.

### 1.2 Choose Your Launch Date Strategically

**Best Days:**
- **Tuesday-Thursday** = Highest traffic days
- Avoid Monday (people catching up) and Friday (weekend mode)
- Avoid holidays and major tech events (WWDC, Google I/O, etc.)

**Best Months:**
- January (New Year resolutions)
- September (post-summer, back to work)
- Avoid December (holidays, low engagement)

### 1.3 Prepare All Launch Assets

**Product Page Requirements:**
- **Product Name:** Clear, memorable, searchable
- **Tagline:** 60 characters max. Hook in 5 words. Example: "Stripe for subscriptions" or "Figma for video editing"
- **Description:** 260 characters max. What it does + who it's for + key benefit
- **Thumbnail/GIF:** 600x600px, 3-5 second loop showing core value
- **Gallery Images:** 5-10 screenshots showing key features
- **Maker Comment:** First comment explaining the story, problem solved, and asking for feedback

**Landing Page Must-Haves:**
- Clear value proposition above the fold
- Signup CTA prominent
- Social proof (testimonials, logos, stats)
- Product demo video (60-90 seconds)
- FAQ section
- Pricing clearly displayed
- Mobile-optimized

### 1.4 Build Your "Hunt" Team

**Roles You Need:**
- **Hunter:** The person who submits your product (can be you or an influential community member)
- **Makers:** Team members who can reply to comments
- **Support Team:** People ready to answer questions in real-time

**Should You Use a Popular Hunter?**
- Pros: Immediate visibility to their followers, credibility boost
- Cons: They may be selective, coordination required
- Alternative: Self-hunt if you have 500+ PH followers and community engagement

### 1.5 Prepare Your Outreach List

**Build These Lists:**
1. **Warm contacts** (people who will definitely upvote): 50-100 people
2. **Network contacts** (colleagues, investors, advisors): 100-200 people
3. **Community supporters** (Twitter followers, newsletter subscribers): 500-5,000+ people
4. **Influencer targets** (people with 10K+ followers who might share)

**Tools for Outreach:**
- Loom for personalized video messages
- Mailchimp/Campaign Monitor for email blasts
- Twitter Lists for social coordination

## Phase 2: Launch Day Execution

### 2.1 Launch Timing

**Product Hunt Day Starts:** 12:01 AM Pacific Time
**Peak Engagement:** 8 AM - 12 PM PT (when West Coast wakes up and East Coast is active)

**Launch Day Schedule:**

| Time (PT) | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| 12:01 AM | Go live, post maker comment, begin outreach to warm contacts |
| 6:00 AM | Follow up with key contacts, post on Twitter/LinkedIn |
| 8:00 AM | Heavy social push begins, engage with all comments |
| 10:00 AM | Peak engagement window - be highly responsive |
| 12:00 PM | Midday update, share milestones ("Top 5!"), continue engagement |
| 3:00 PM | Afternoon push, second wave of outreach |
| 6:00 PM | Evening engagement, thank supporters |
| 9:00 PM | Final push before day ends |
| 11:59 PM | Day ends - results finalized at midnight |

### 2.2 The First Hour is Critical

**Goals for First Hour:**
- 50-100 upvotes from warm contacts
- 20+ thoughtful comments
- Reply to every comment within 5 minutes

**Why it matters:** Product Hunt's algorithm heavily weights early engagement. Products that get traction in the first 2 hours get featured on the homepage and in newsletters.

### 2.3 Crafting Your Maker Comment

**Template Structure:**
```
Hi Product Hunters! 👋

[Hook: One sentence on what you built]

[Problem: What pain point does this solve?]

[Solution: How does your product solve it?]

[Differentiation: What makes you unique?]

[Ask: Request feedback, upvotes, or specific input]

[Gratitude: Thank the community]

-Maker Name, Role @ Company
```

**Example:**
> "Hi Product Hunters! 👋
> 
> We built [Product] because we were tired of [specific problem].
> 
> [Product] lets you [core benefit] without [common pain point of alternatives].
> 
> Unlike [competitors], we [key differentiator - e.g., 'don't require a credit card' or 'take 30 seconds to set up'].
> 
> We'd love your feedback! What's one feature you'd want to see us build next?
> 
> -John, Co-founder @ Company"

### 2.4 Managing Comments

**Response Strategy:**
- Reply to EVERY comment within 5-10 minutes during peak hours
- Be authentic, not corporate
- Ask follow-up questions to drive engagement
- Thank people for specific feedback
- Address criticism gracefully

**Comment Templates:**
- For praise: "Thanks [Name]! We built this specifically because [reason]. What feature are you most excited to try?"
- For questions: "Great question! [Answer]. Anything else you'd like to know?"
- For criticism: "Thanks for the honest feedback, [Name]. You're right that [acknowledge concern]. We're working on [solution] - would you be open to beta testing when ready?"

### 2.5 Social Media Coordination

**Twitter Strategy:**
- Thread format works best (5-10 tweets)
- Tweet 1: Launch announcement with link
- Tweet 2: The problem you solve
- Tweet 3: Your solution (with GIF/demo)
- Tweet 4: Social proof or traction
- Tweet 5: Call to action (upvote + feedback)
- Pin the thread to your profile

**LinkedIn Strategy:**
- More professional tone
- Focus on the story/journey
- Tag team members and advisors
- Share in relevant groups (if allowed)

**Email Strategy:**
- Send to your full list at 8 AM PT
- Subject line: "We're live on Product Hunt today! 🚀"
- Keep it short: 3-4 paragraphs max
- Clear CTA button: "Check us out on Product Hunt"
- Personalize if sending 1:1

**Result:** #1 Product of the Day, #1 Product of the Week

**What They Did:**
- Launched with a simple, clear value prop: "Record and share video messages"
- Demo GIF showed exactly how it worked in 3 seconds
- CEO personally replied to 200+ comments

**Result:** #1 Product of the Day, viral growth

**What They Did:**
- Exclusive invite-only access (scarcity)

**Key Lesson:** Scarcity and exclusivity can drive engagement, but product must deliver.

## The Product Hunt Algorithm (What We Know)

**Factors That Influence Ranking:**

1. **Vote Velocity** (Weighted heavily)
   - Upvotes in first 2 hours matter most
   - Consistent engagement throughout day
   - Quality of voters (established accounts count more)

2. **Comment Engagement**
   - Number of comments
   - Quality/thoughtfulness
   - Maker responsiveness
   - Thread depth (replies to replies)

3. **Social Signals**
   - External traffic from Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.
   - Time on site from Product Hunt visitors
   - Signup conversion rate

4. **Account History**
   - Established makers get slight boost
   - Previous successful launches help
   - Community engagement history

**What Doesn't Work:**
- Buying upvotes (PH detects and penalizes)
- Fake accounts (algorithm identifies patterns)
- Bot traffic (filtered out)
- Asking for upvotes publicly (can get you banned)

## Advanced Tactics

### 1. The "Rolling Launch" Strategy

Launch at 12:01 AM PT with your network in Asia/Europe, then have Americas join at 8 AM PT for second wave.

**Pros:** Sustained engagement across timezones
**Cons:** Requires coordination, exhausting

### 2. Influencer Seeding

2-4 weeks before launch, give early access to micro-influencers (5K-50K followers) in your space. Ask them to support on launch day.

### 3. The "Special Offer" Hook

Create Product Hunt exclusive:
- Extended free trial (30 days vs 14)
- Discount code (PH30 for 30% off)
- Lifetime deal for first 100
- Exclusive feature access

### 4. Live Demo/Launch Party

Host a live stream during peak hours (10 AM PT) showing your product, answering questions, building in public.

### 5. The Story Arc

Build narrative before launch:
- 4 weeks out: Tease on Twitter
- 2 weeks out: "Building in public" thread
- 1 week out: Behind-the-scenes content
- Launch day: Full reveal
- Post-launch: Results and lessons

## Final Thoughts

### The Product Hunt Mindset

1. **It's a marathon, not a sprint.** One launch won't make or break you.
2. **Community first.** Genuine engagement beats spam every time.
3. **Product quality matters most.** Great products get upvoted; bad products get buried.
4. **Iterate and relaunch.** Major updates can be re-launched 6+ months later.
5. **Build relationships.** The connections you make last beyond launch day.

### Success Metrics Beyond Rank

Don't just chase #1. A "successful" launch might mean:
- 100 new qualified signups
- 5 meaningful investor conversations
- 3 potential partnership opportunities
- 50 pieces of actionable feedback
- 1 key hire who found you through PH

### When to Relaunch

Product Hunt allows relaunches for:
- Major product updates (new version, major feature)
- 6+ months since last launch
- Significant pivot or rebrand
- New platform (iOS app after web launch)
