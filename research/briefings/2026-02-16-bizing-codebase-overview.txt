Bizing Codebase Overview. Technical Architecture and Stack.

Bizing is a modern API first platform for selling services and digital products online. Built with TypeScript and designed for the AI age.

Project Structure.

Bizing follows a monorepo architecture using Turborepo and PNPM. The codebase is organized into two main directories. Apps and Packages.

The Apps directory contains two applications.

First is the API. A Hono based REST API server running on Node.js. This handles all business logic, database operations, and external integrations. It includes OpenAPI documentation and serves as the backend for the entire platform.

Second is the Admin dashboard. A Next.js 14 application providing the user interface for managing services, bookings, customers, and business operations.

The Packages directory contains shared modules.

DB package uses Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL. It defines all database schemas and handles migrations.

Schema package contains Zod validation schemas used across the application for type safety and input validation.

Tech Stack Overview.

Runtime is Node.js version 20 plus. The API framework is Hono with Zod OpenAPI integration, providing type safe API endpoints with automatic documentation.

Frontend uses Next.js 14 with React and Tailwind CSS for styling.

Database is PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type safe database operations.

Authentication uses Better Auth for secure user management.

Monorepo tooling includes Turborepo for task orchestration and PNPM for package management.

Development Workflow.

Quick start requires Node.js 20, PNPM 9, and PostgreSQL 14. Install with PNPM install. Run database migrations with PNPM DB migrate. Start development with PNPM dev.

The API server runs on localhost port 6000 with documentation at slash doc. The admin dashboard runs on localhost port 9000.

Key Features.

Bizing supports multiple service types including one time bookings, recurring subscriptions, group classes with registration, and time based resource rentals. The platform handles businesses, services, availability management, and customer bookings.

The memory folder serves as an Obsidian vault for design exploration, containing workflow documentation, coding rules, and daily notes.

Development Principles.

Work happens on feature branches, never directly on main. All commits require confirmation. CodeSync ensures type checking and tests pass before commits. Feature branches merge via pull requests only.
