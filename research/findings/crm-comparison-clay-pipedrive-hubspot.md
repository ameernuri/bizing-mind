# CRM Research: Clay
  - Pipedrive
  - HubSpot Analysis

> What Bizing can learn from modern CRMs

---

## Executive Summary

Analyzed three leading CRM platforms to identify features worth integrating into Bizing's customer management system.

**Key Finding:** Most CRMs focus on pre-booking (lead gen) or are generic. Bizing's opportunity is a **post-booking CRM** built specifically for booking businesses.

---

## 1. Clay.com — Data Enrichment + AI

**What they do:**
- Combine 75+ data sources into one enrichment layer
- AI-powered research (reads websites
  - PDFs
  - does Google searches)
- Automated outreach with AI-drafted messages
- Prospecting from 10+ sources

**Pricing:** $0-$720/mo (credit-based)

**What's RIGHT:**
- Credit-based pricing (pay for usage
  - not seats)
- AI research automation replaces manual SDR work
- Data aggregation vs. 10+ subscriptions
- Wholesale data pricing (no markup)

**What's WRONG:**
- Complex for small teams (enterprise-focused)
- Credit system confusion (hard to predict costs)
- No booking/scheduling (pure enrichment)
- Overkill for simple CRM needs

**For Bizing:** Not a fit — Clay is pre-booking
  - Bizing is post-booking

---

## 2. Pipedrive — Sales Pipeline CRM

**What they do:**
- Visual sales pipeline (Kanban-style deal tracking)
- Activity-based selling (focus on actions that close deals)
- Email automation with tracking
- AI sales assistant (suggests next actions)
- 500+ integrations

**Pricing:** ~$15-$100/user/mo

**What's RIGHT:**
- Visual pipeline (intuitive for sales teams)
- Mobile-first (strong iOS/Android apps)
- Email integration (tracks opens
  - clicks
  - replies)
- Automation reduces admin work
- Focus on "what to do next"

**What's WRONG:**
- Sales-only (no booking/scheduling built-in)
- Per-user pricing (gets expensive)
- No enrichment (needs Clay/ZoomInfo)
- Generic (works for any industry)

**For Bizing:** Partial fit — good CRM foundation
  - lacks booking context

---

## 3. HubSpot CRM — All-in-One Platform

**What they do:**
- Free CRM (unlimited contacts
  - basic features)
- Marketing + Sales + Service (full customer journey)
- Email marketing with automation
- Website analytics

**What's RIGHT:**
- Free tier ($0 to start)
- All-in-one (marketing
  - sales
  - service unified)
- 1,000+ integrations
- Content + CRM (blog
  - landing pages
  - email)

**What's WRONG:**
- Expensive at scale ($800+/mo for full features)
- Bloated (too many features
  - complexity)
- Generic (not designed for booking)
- Steep learning curve

**For Bizing:** Partial fit — good foundation
  - overkill and expensive

**Bizing's opportunity:**
- Post-booking CRM — customer management AFTER they book
- Booking-native — pipeline stages match booking lifecycle
- Commission-aware — track revenue
  - not just deals

---

## Recommended Features for Bizing CRM

**Core:**
1. Customer timeline — all bookings
  - messages
  - payments in one view
2. Booking pipeline — Confirmed → Preparing → In Progress → Complete → Review
3. Revenue tracking — commission calculation
  - payout timing
4. Automated follow-ups — review requests
  - rebooking prompts
5. Customer segments — VIP
