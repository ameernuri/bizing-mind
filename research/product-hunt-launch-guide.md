## Pre-Launch Preparation (2-4 Weeks Before)

### 1. Build Your Product Hunt Profile
- **Create an Account**: Be an active community member before launching
- **Engage Authentically**: Comment on other products, build relationships
- **Build Karma**: Upvote and support other makers (don't be transactional)
- **Complete Your Profile**: Professional photo, bio, and social links
- **Warm Up Your Account**: Start engaging 2-4 weeks before launch

### 2. Prepare Your Launch Assets

#### Visual Assets
- **Gallery Images**: 5-7 high-quality screenshots/GIFs (minimum 1350x900px)

- **Video**: 30-60 second demo video (highly recommended)
- **Makers Photo**: Professional headshot of the team

#### Copy Elements

- **Tagline**: One sentence that explains what you do (under 60 characters)
- **Description**: Detailed but concise (2-3 paragraphs)
- **First Comment**: Your launch story and call-to-action

### 3. Choose the Right Hunter
- **What is a Hunter?**: Someone who submits your product to Product Hunt
- **Top Hunters**: Have large followings and can drive initial traffic
- **Finding Hunters**: 
  - Research past products in your category
  - Check hunter leaderboards (Ryan Hoover, Chris Messina, etc.)
  - Reach out personally with a compelling pitch
- ** DIY Option**: You can hunt your own product, but a known hunter helps

### 4. Build Your Support Network
- **Create a Launch List**: 50-200 people who will support on launch day
- **Categories of Supporters**:
  - Personal network (friends, family, colleagues)
  - Beta users and early adopters
  - Online communities you're active in
  - Email subscribers
  - Social media followers
- **Prepare Your Outreach**: Draft personalized messages in advance
- **Set Expectations**: Ask for upvotes AND thoughtful comments

### 5. Timing Your Launch
- **Best Days**: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday (avoid Monday and Friday)
- **Best Time**: 12:01 AM PST (right when the day resets)
- **Avoid**: Major holidays, major tech events (Apple keynotes, etc.)
- **Time Zone Consideration**: PST midnight = 3 AM EST = 8 AM GMT

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Before Launch
1. **Not Engaging with Community First**: Cold launches rarely succeed
2. **Poor Visuals**: Low-quality screenshots hurt credibility
3. **Unclear Value Proposition**: Tagline must explain what you do immediately
4. **Not Having a Hunter**: Top products usually have established hunters
5. **Rushing the Launch**: Insufficient preparation leads to poor execution

### During Launch
1. **Asking for Upvotes Directly**: Product Hunt penalizes this (ask for "support" or "feedback")
2. **Using Bots or Fake Accounts**: Will get you banned
3. **Ignoring Comments**: Engagement is as important as upvotes
4. **Launching at Wrong Time**: Poor timing = less visibility
5. **Not Being Present**: You must be active throughout launch day

### After Launch
1. **Not Following Up**: Missing the opportunity to convert visitors
2. **Ignoring Feedback**: Product Hunt comments often contain valuable insights
3. **Not Capitalizing on Press**: Top products get media attention
4. **Failing to Analyze**: Not learning from the experience
