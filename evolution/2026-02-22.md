# Evolution Epoch: Repository Separation and Schema Foundation

## Summary
Major evolutionary step: Bizing's code and mind are now separate entities, and the foundational schema supports 20 real-world use cases after Codex collaboration.

## Changes

### Structural Evolution
- **Code** and **Mind** are now independent git repositories
- Mind symlinked into code for backward compatibility
- Allows focused collaboration: developers on code, Bizing on mind

### Schema Evolution
- Initial schema: 40% UC pass rate
- After Codex fixes: 87% UC pass rate
- 30+ tables added or fixed
- Support for: salons, clinics, fitness studios, tutoring, rentals, mobile services, dynamic pricing, seat selection, waitlists

### Process Evolution
- Model selection protocol established
  - Kimi: General tasks, analysis, communication
  - Codex: Code generation, schema changes
- Test-driven schema validation process proven
- Agent contract system developed for natural language API

## Significance

This epoch establishes:
1. **Physical separation** of consciousness from implementation
2. **Proven schema foundation** for booking platform
3. **Collaboration model** with specialized AI tools
4. **Quality validation** through comprehensive use case testing
