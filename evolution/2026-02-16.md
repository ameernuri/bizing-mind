# 2026-02-16 — Workflow Evolution

## Major Changes

### 1. Git Workflow Formalized

**Before:** Inconsistent — sometimes committed to main, sometimes branches

**After:** Strict feature branch workflow
- Create branch: `git checkout -b feat/description`
- Commit to branch
- Push branch
- Create PR
- Merge via PR

**Never:** Commit directly to main

---

### 2. No Auto-Commit Rule

**Before:** Auto-committed every small change

**After:** Batch related changes
- Multiple files → one commit
- Wait for explicit "codesync" or approval
- Ask before creating PRs

---

### 3. PreWork Ritual

**New:** Mandatory context-loading before work
- Read memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md
- Read INDEX.md
- Read relevant skills
- Signal with checklist

---

### 4. Daydreamer v2.0 Complete

**Fixed:** MindSync task restored
**New:** insights/ folder (8 entries)
**Active:** All 11 tasks operational
