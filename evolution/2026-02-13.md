- CodeSync skill — Quality-gated commit workflow with explicit approval
- MindSync skill — SOFT vs HARD mind update processes
- Memory skill — Forces session logging, prevents knowledge loss
- INDEX.md reorganized with wikilinks to all skills
- 7 redundant files deleted (SUMMARY, WORKFLOW, FRAMEWORK, etc.)
