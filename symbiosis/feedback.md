## Today's Learnings

### From Today's Session (2026-02-16) — NEVER Commit to Main

- [2026-02-16] **Critical workflow rule** — Never commit directly to main
  - Always create feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/description`
  - Always create PR, never direct commit
  - Always ask for approval before committing
  - Violated this rule, user corrected immediately

- [2026-02-16] **CodeSync vs MindSync** — Separate processes
  - CodeSync: Commit code on feature branch → PR → Merge
  - MindSync: Update mind files (.md) after code changes
  - Order: CodeSync first, then MindSync

- [2026-02-16] **No auto-commit rule** — Don't commit every small change

## Key Learnings

### Tag Format (Correct!)
```yaml
---
date: 2026-02-14
tags:
  - skill
  - dreaming
  - dreamer
  - loop
  - dissonance
  - curiosity
---
```

### Tag Format (Wrong!)
```yaml
---
date: 2026-02-14
tags: skill, dreaming, dreamer, loop, dissonance, curiosity
---
```

### Skill Naming Convention
- Before: `skills/category/SKILL.md`
- After: `skills/category/DescriptiveName.md`

Example:
- `skills/dreaming/Dreaming.md`
- `skills/memory/Memory.md`
- `skills/curiosity/Curiosity.md`

---

*Always use YAML array format for tags.*
