Definitive Guide for Field Service and Dispatch Setup. Version Zero.

Latest Schema Notes as of February twenty first twenty twenty six. Coverage rerun remains complete with two hundred fifty seven out of two hundred fifty seven use case lines mapped. Totals show one hundred forty four full coverage and one hundred thirteen strong coverage. Customer and contact handling is now more reusable through CRM contacts plus CRM contact channels which helps field service intake and communication stay consistent with customer relationship management and quote flows. Active anchor uniqueness for participant and membership models is now null safe via split partial unique indexes for contact versus subject paths.

Who This Is For. Use this setup for mobile operations like plumbing, heating ventilation and air conditioning, and inspections. Routing with estimated time of arrival and on site evidence. Mandatory callout and arrival fees. Parts, inventory, and post visit settlement. In simple terms, get the right person with the right equipment to the right place with full money trace.

Core Backbone. First, commercial contract includes booking orders, booking order lines, and booking order line sellables. Second, executable work includes fulfillment units, fulfillment assignments, and fulfillment checkpoints. Third, dispatch and transport includes transport routes, transport trips, and transport route stops plus dispatch tasks, ETA events, fleet vehicles, and trip manifests. Fourth, resource readiness includes resources with status, capacity, and buffers as source of operational truth plus resource maintenance policies, resource maintenance work orders, and resource condition reports. Fifth, parts and physical delivery includes inventory items, inventory reservations, inventory movements, physical fulfillments, and physical fulfillment items.

Setup Playbook. First, publish services and offers by defining service intent in services, service products, and offers. Second, bind availability using calendars, calendar bindings, and availability rules plus add buffers and dependency rules for realistic travel and turnover. Third, dispatch with checkpoints by assigning fulfillment to resources and emitting checkpoints for depart, arrive, start, and complete. Fourth, apply call fees cleanly by representing callout and arrival fees as explicit order lines and settle via split tender payment model with payment intent tenders and payment transactions. Fifth, close with evidence by attaching photos, signatures, and notes via work and interaction domains and reconcile inventory movements to final commercial lines.

High Value Patterns. Host availability depends on front desk or support modeled with availability dependency rules. Emergency hours pricing uses pricing overrides plus fee lines. Maintenance lockouts set resource status and let scheduling enforce availability impact. Queue and slot together can both exist on same offer path using shared capacity and calendar state.

Common Mistakes. Treating dispatch as user interface only state. Hiding fees in metadata instead of order lines. Scheduling assets or hosts without checking resource maintenance state. Skipping checkpoint evidence for field compliance.

Health Checklist. Every visit has a fulfillment assignment timeline. Every fee is visible as a line and linked to payment flow. Every part consumed has inventory movement history. Every on site outcome has evidence artifacts.
