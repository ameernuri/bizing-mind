Definitive Guide for Enterprise and Franchise Setup. Version Zero.

Latest Schema Notes as of February twenty first twenty twenty six. Coverage rerun remains complete with two hundred fifty seven out of two hundred fifty seven use case lines mapped. Totals show one hundred forty four full coverage and one hundred thirteen strong coverage. Cross domain contact identity in enterprise flows is now cleaner via CRM contacts plus CRM contact channels reducing duplicate user and group contact modeling. Quote decision actors are normalized to contact and subject anchors which makes enterprise approval and delegated signing trails easier to extend without schema branching.

Who This Is For. Use this setup for one parent network with many member businesses and locations, central standards with local overrides, delegated authority with strict auditability, and intercompany financial traceability. In simple terms, one big company brain, many local hands.

Core Backbone. First, network topology includes enterprise relationship templates and enterprise relationships. Second, unified scope primitive which is most important includes enterprise scopes with one reusable scope row for network, business, location, or subject reused by inheritance, delegation, contract binding, and rollout targets. Third, override and inheritance control plane includes enterprise inheritance strategies and enterprise inheritance resolutions. Fourth, delegated admin and approval caps include enterprise admin delegations and enterprise approval authority limits. Fifth, policy and contract rollout across network includes enterprise contract pack templates, enterprise contract pack versions, enterprise contract pack bindings, enterprise change rollout runs, enterprise change rollout targets, and enterprise change rollout results. Sixth, intercompany ledger and settlement includes enterprise intercompany accounts, enterprise intercompany entries, and enterprise intercompany settlement runs. Seventh, enterprise identity integration includes enterprise identity providers, enterprise SCIM sync states, and enterprise external directory links. Eighth, fast network analytics includes fact enterprise revenue daily, fact enterprise utilization daily, and fact enterprise compliance daily.

Setup Playbook. First, define relationship language first by creating template keys like parent of, franchise of, region of, then create actual graph edges in enterprise relationships. Second, create canonical scopes once by inserting rows into enterprise scopes for every level you manage and reuse scope ID everywhere instead of duplicating scope columns. Third, define inheritance policies including pricing, policy, and config inheritance in enterprise inheritance strategies and materialize resolved values in enterprise inheritance resolutions. Fourth, roll out standards safely by versioning packs in enterprise contract pack versions, binding by scope in enterprise contract pack bindings, and executing phased rollout with enterprise change rollout tables. Fifth, wire authority safely by granting delegated rights with enterprise admin delegations and setting money and approval caps in enterprise approval authority limits. Sixth, add financial governance by opening lanes in enterprise intercompany accounts, writing entries in enterprise intercompany entries, and closing windows with settlement runs.

High Value Patterns. Use enterprise control plane with core commerce and scheduling domains including selling with sellables, offers, service products, and booking orders. Execution with fulfillment units and fulfillment assignments. Time with calendars, calendar bindings, and availability rules. Cross business trading with cross business contracts and cross business orders. Rule of thumb is enterprise tables decide policy and authority while core commerce tables execute demand and money.

Common Mistakes. Duplicating scope columns in custom tables instead of referencing enterprise scopes. Encoding hierarchy in app only config instead of enterprise relationships. Running big rollouts without enterprise change rollout results evidence. Blending intercompany accounting with customer payment rows.

Health Checklist. Every enterprise targeted rule references scope ID. Every delegated authority row has clear effective window. Every policy rollout has per target result history. Every intercompany transfer is in ledger and settlement runs. Network dashboards can read from fact enterprise tables without ad hoc SQL.
