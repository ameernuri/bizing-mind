Definitive Guide for Regulated Healthcare Setup. Version Zero.

Latest Schema Notes as of February twenty first twenty twenty six. Coverage rerun remains complete with two hundred fifty seven out of two hundred fifty seven use case lines mapped. Totals show one hundred forty four full coverage and one hundred thirteen strong coverage. Shared contact and endpoint identity using CRM contacts and CRM contact channels improves clinical communication and intake consistency while staying compatible with governance and audit controls. Quote acceptance actor normalization to contact and subject anchors improves legal traceability without hardcoding user or group shapes per regulated workflow.

Who This Is For. Use this setup for clinics and regulated care operations, provider, room, and equipment constraints, payer pre-authorization and eligibility checks, and HIPAA grade access and disclosure controls. In simple terms, deliver care and prove that every sensitive action was safe and justified.

Core Backbone. First, care selling and execution includes services, service products, offers, and offer versions plus booking orders and booking order lines plus fulfillment units, fulfillment assignments, and fulfillment checkpoints. Second, clinical scheduling integrity includes resources plus capability selectors plus calendars, calendar bindings, availability rules, and capacity holds. Third, payer and eligibility control includes payer authorizations and eligibility snapshots. Fourth, HIPAA and governance control plane includes PHI access policies and PHI access events, HIPAA authorizations, PHI disclosure events, break glass reviews, business associate agreements, plus security incidents and breach notifications. Fifth, policy and remediation includes policy templates, policy rules, and policy bindings plus policy breach events and policy consequence events.

Setup Playbook. First, publish care flows with constrained selectors defining what roles and resources are required per service product. Second, gate sensitive bookings with workflow using pre-checks and review queues before irreversible steps. Third, capture payer snapshots at decision moments and do not overwrite old eligibility or pre-authorization decisions. Fourth, enforce minimum necessary access by evaluating policy then logging every protected health information access event. Fifth, handle emergency access explicitly requiring break glass reason plus post review row. Sixth, keep disclosure accounting complete with every disclosure in PHI disclosure events with purpose and legal context.

High Value Patterns. Provider plus room plus equipment coupling through requirement selectors. Consent and intake forms through interaction and signature artifacts. Incident and breach workflows with retained evidence and timelines. Policy violations tied to explicit consequence events.

Common Mistakes. Using app logs instead of protected health information access and disclosure ledgers. Replacing payer decisions instead of storing snapshots. Modeling emergency access without post review record. Mixing compliance evidence with mutable business notes.

Health Checklist. Every protected health information access has policy and actor context. Every break glass event has review outcome. Every payer sensitive booking has snapshot lineage. Every breach or incident has lifecycle records.
