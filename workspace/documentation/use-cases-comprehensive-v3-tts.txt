Bizing Booking Use Cases Version 3. Comprehensive Catalog. Explained in spoken word format.

Configuration Principle. Simple setup must stay simple. For common small business use cases, owners should launch with a short setup flow. Select service type, set weekly hours, set base price and duration, add cancellation or deposit policy, publish booking link. No advanced rule builder required.

Complex setup must still be possible. For advanced businesses, the platform supports layered rules without forcing them onto simple users.
