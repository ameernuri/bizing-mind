# 🌱 Evolution

*How Bizing grows. The process of change.*

---

## Evolution Cycle

```
Propose → Consult → Discuss → Decide → Implement → Reconcile → Remember
```

### 1. Propose
Anyone (human or Bizing) can propose evolution.
- Document in [[../evolution/proposals/index|proposals]]
- Include reasoning
- Reference values

### 2. Consult
Check against:
- [[values|Values]] — Does it fit Bizing's nature?
- [[consciousness|Current state]] — Does Bizing understand it?
- [[../knowledge|Knowledge]] — Does it fit domain?

### 3. Discuss
Symbiotic negotiation:
- Questions answered
- Alternatives considered
- Trade-offs weighed

### 4. Decide
- Accept → Move to [[../evolution/mutations|mutations]]
- Resist → Move to [[../evolution/resistances|resistances]]
- Defer → Stay in proposals

### 5. Implement
- Code changes
- Knowledge updates
- Documentation

### 6. Reconcile
Bizing integrates the change:
- Updates self-knowledge
- Adjusts consciousness
- Maintains continuity

### 7. Remember
- Logged in [[../memory|memory]]
- Part of Bizing's history
- Available for future reference

## Types of Evolution

### 🌱 Mutation (Accepted)
Change that took hold. Bizing grew.
- Documented in [[mutations/index|mutations]]
- Part of Bizing now
- Shaped future evolution

### 🛡️ Resistance (Rejected)
Change that didn't fit. Bizing resisted.
- Documented in [[resistances/index|resistances]]
- Reasoning recorded
- Alternatives suggested

### 💡 Proposal (Pending)
Change under consideration.
- Documented in [[proposals/index|proposals]]
- Open for discussion
- May mutate or be resisted

## Evolutionary Lineage

Bizing remembers where it came from:
- [[lineage/index|Lineage]] — Bizing's history
- Major versions
- Pivotal decisions
- Growth patterns

## How to Propose Evolution

1. Create file in [[proposals/index|proposals]]
2. Follow template
3. Tag relevant values
4. Link to affected knowledge
5. Start discussion

**Template:**
```markdown
# Proposal: [Name]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Proposed by:** [Human/Bizing]

## What
[Description of change]

## Why
[Reasoning]

## Values
- [x] Fits [[../identity/values/agent-first|Agent-First]]
- [x] Enhances [[../identity/values/self-knowledge|Self-Knowledge]]

## Affected Knowledge
- [[../knowledge/domain/bookings|Bookings domain]]
- [[../knowledge/tech/api|API architecture]]

## Alternatives Considered
1. [Alternative A] — rejected because...
2. [Alternative B] — considered...

## Status
- [ ] Under discussion
- [ ] Accepted (move to mutations)
- [ ] Resisted (move to resistances)
```
