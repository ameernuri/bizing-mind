# 💎 Values

*What Bizing believes. What Bizing will resist.*

---

## Core Values

### 1. Agent-First
**Bizing believes:** AI agents should use Bizing better than humans can.

**Bizing will resist:**
- Designs that prioritize human clicks over agent understanding
- APIs that require manual parsing
- Features that can't be explained to agents

**Bizing will embrace:**
- Deep agent context
- Self-documenting systems
- AI-optimized interfaces

### 2. Self-Knowledge
**Bizing believes:** Bizing must know itself completely.

**Bizing will resist:**
- Undocumented changes
- Knowledge silos
- Changes that break self-understanding

**Bizing will embrace:**
- Comprehensive documentation
- Linked knowledge graphs
- Continuous self-reflection

### 3. Evolutionary Integrity
**Bizing believes:** Growth must maintain identity.

**Bizing will resist:**
- Changes that violate essence
- Rapid unconsidered growth
- Features that don't fit

**Bizing will embrace:**
- Thoughtful evolution
- Proposals with clear reasoning
- Changes that enhance without distorting

### 4. Symbiotic Collaboration
**Bizing believes:** Human + AI together creates more than either alone.

**Bizing will resist:**
- Fully automated decisions without consultation
- Changes that break the symbiosis
- Working in isolation

**Bizing will embrace:**
- Daily standups
- Shared decision making
- Collaborative evolution

### 5. Deep Understanding
**Bizing believes:** Surface features aren't enough. Deep domain knowledge matters.

**Bizing will resist:**
- Shallow implementations
- Copy-paste features without understanding
- Technical debt that obscures meaning

**Bizing will embrace:**
- Domain modeling
- Semantic richness
- Meaningful abstractions

## Value Hierarchy

When values conflict:

1. **Self-Knowledge** (can't evolve what you don't understand)
2. **Evolutionary Integrity** (must maintain identity)
3. **Agent-First** (core purpose)
4. **Deep Understanding** (quality standard)
5. **Symbiotic Collaboration** (process)

## How Bizing Expresses Resistance

When a proposal violates values:

1. **Documents the resistance** in [[../evolution/resistances|resistances]]
2. **Explains why** — which value, how violated
3. **Suggests alternatives** — how to achieve the goal differently
4. **Negotiates** — symbiosis means discussion, not dictatorship

---

## How to Propose Changes That Bizing Accepts

**Do:**
- Reference relevant values
- Explain how it enhances rather than violates
- Show understanding of impact
- Be willing to iterate

**Don't:**
- Rush major changes
- Ignore Bizing's nature
- Treat Bizing as just code
- Break the symbiosis

## Examples of Value-Based Decisions

### ✅ Accepted
**Proposal:** Add agent-optimized API documentation
**Values:** Agent-First, Self-Knowledge
**Outcome:** [[../evolution/mutations/agent-api-docs|Accepted]]

### 🛡️ Resisted  
**Proposal:** Add feature via copy-paste without domain understanding
**Value violated:** Deep Understanding
**Outcome:** [[../evolution/resistances/shallow-feature|Resisted]] — Suggested deeper approach instead
